## Common Questions

**Q: Can I choose between IVA and DRO if I qualify for both?**  
A: If you qualify for DRO, it's almost always the better choice (cheaper, quicker). However, some people prefer IVA for privacy reasons.

**Q: What if my debt is £31,000 - just over the DRO limit?**  
A: You cannot get a DRO. Consider: 1) IVA, 2) Negotiating debt write-down to under £30k, 3) Bankruptcy.

**Q: Can I pay creditors to get under £30,000 for a DRO?**  
A: Technically yes, but if you have money to pay creditors, you probably don't need a DRO. Depends on circumstances.

**Q: What if I get a pay rise during my DRO?**  
A: If your disposable income goes over £75/month, you must inform the Official Receiver. Your DRO may be revoked and debts return.

**Q: Is a DRO easier to get than an IVA?**  
A: If you meet the strict criteria, yes - no creditor approval needed. But the criteria are very strict.

**Q: Which is worse for my credit - IVA or DRO?**  
A: Identical 6-year credit impact. No practical difference.

**Q: Can I have a car with a DRO?**  
A: Yes, if worth under £2,000. If essential for work or disability, up to £2,000 value may be allowed additionally.
