| **Duration** | 5-6 years | 12 months (discharged) |
| **Debt Written Off** | Yes (remaining after term) | Yes (most unsecured debts) |
| **Cost** | £0 upfront (fees from payments) | £680 upfront |
| **Keep Your Home** | Usually ✅ | Usually ❌ (if equity) |
| **Keep Your Car** | Usually ✅ | Maybe (if worth under £2,000) |
| **Monthly Payments** | Yes (fixed term) | Maybe (up to 3 years if surplus income) |
| **Credit Impact** | 6 years | 6 years |
| **Public Record** | Yes (Insolvency Register) | Yes (Gazette + Register) |
| **Affect Employment** | Rarely | Some professions restricted |
| **Self-Employed** | Can continue | May need to cease trading |
| **Creditor Approval** | Required (75%) | Not required |

## Detailed Comparison

### 1. How They Work

#### IVA Process
1. Consult licensed Insolvency Practitioner
2. IP prepares proposal
3. Creditors vote (need 75% approval)
4. Make monthly payments for 5-6 years
5. Remaining debt written off at completion

**Control**: You and your IP design the arrangement

#### Bankruptcy Process
1. Apply online or via court
2. Pay £680 fee
3. Adjudicator reviews and makes you bankrupt
4. Official Receiver takes control
5. Assets may be sold
6. Discharged after 12 months

**Control**: Official Receiver has control

### 2. Duration

#### IVA Duration
- **Standard term**: 60 months (5 years)
- **With equity release**: 60 months
- **Extended**: 72 months (6 years) if can't release equity
- **Payment phase**: Full duration

**Implications**: Long commitment but predictable

#### Bankruptcy Duration
- **Discharge**: Usually 12 months
- **Income Payments Order (IPO)**: Up to 3 years if surplus income
- **Restrictions**: 12 months typically
- **Long-term impact**: Minimum 12 months

**Implications**: Much quicker resolution

### 3. Cost Comparison

#### IVA Costs
- **Upfront**: £0
- **Nominee fee**: £1,000-£2,000 (from first payments)
- **Supervisor fee**: 15-20% of each payment
- **Total typical cost**: £5,000-£8,000 over term
- **Disbursements**: Usually included

**Who pays**: Built into your monthly payments

#### Bankruptcy Costs
- **Upfront**: £680 (must pay before bankruptcy order)
- **Adjudicator fee**: £130
- **Court fee**: £550
- **Total**: £680 minimum
- **Official Receiver fees**: May be deducted from assets

**Who pays**: You pay upfront or have it paid for you by creditor

**Comparison**: Bankruptcy much cheaper IF you can afford upfront cost

### 4. Assets: Keep or Lose?

#### IVA - Assets Generally Protected

**Your home**:
- ✅ Usually keep it
- Must attempt equity release in year 5
- If can't release, extend IVA 12 months
- Rarely forced to sell

**Your car**:
- ✅ Keep if reasonable value
- Essential for work usually protected
- May need to downgrade if luxury vehicle
- Typical limit: £2,000-£5,000 value

**Other assets**:
- ✅ Household contents protected
- ✅ Tools of trade protected
- May need to sell luxury items
- Pensions protected

**Example**: Home with £50k equity
- IVA: Attempt to remortgage; if not possible, extend 12 months
- Keep your home ✅

#### Bankruptcy - Assets at Risk

**Your home**:
- ❌ Usually must be sold if you have equity
- Even small equity (£5,000+) triggers sale
- Trustee gets your share
- 12-month grace period, then forced sale possible

**Your car**:
- ⚠️ Keep only if worth under £2,000 approximately
- If worth more and needed for work, may buy back excess value
- Otherwise sold

**Other assets**:
- ⚠️ Anything valuable may be sold
- Household contents worth under £500 per item usually safe
- Tools of trade up to reasonable value protected
- Pensions protected

**Example**: Home with £50k equity
- Bankruptcy: Your share sold (minus small exemption)
- Lose your home ❌

**KEY DIFFERENCE**: IVAs protect assets far better than bankruptcy

### 5. Income and Payments

#### IVA Payments
- **Amount**: Based on disposable income
- **Minimum**: Usually £80-£100/month
- **Duration**: 60-72 months guaranteed
- **Reviews**: Annual reviews may increase payments
- **Bonuses/windfalls**: May increase payments
- **Certainty**: Know exactly how long you'll pay

**Example**:
- Income: £1,800/month
- Expenses: £1,600/month
- Disposable: £200/month
- IVA payment: £200 x 60 months = £12,000 total

#### Bankruptcy Payments
- **Amount**: Based on disposable income (if any)
- **Minimum**: None if no surplus income
- **Duration**: Up to 36 months via Income Payments Order (IPO)
- **Reviews**: Annual reviews possible
- **Bonuses/windfalls**: May trigger IPO or increase payments
- **Certainty**: May pay nothing if low income

**Example 1: Surplus Income**
- Income: £1,800/month
- Expenses: £1,600/month
- Disposable: £200/month
- IPO payment: £200 x 36 months = £7,200 total

**Example 2: No Surplus Income**
- Income: £1,200/month (benefits)
- Expenses: £1,200/month
- Disposable: £0/month
- IPO payment: £0 total

**KEY DIFFERENCE**: Bankruptcy may be cheaper if you have no disposable income

### 6. Employment Impact

#### IVA Employment Impact
- **Most jobs**: No impact at all
- **Financial services**: Some restrictions
- **Company directors**: May need to check company articles
- **Professional bodies**: Some require disclosure
- **Public sector**: Usually no impact
- **Police/Armed forces**: Need to declare

**Reality**: 95%+ of people can continue their job unchanged

#### Bankruptcy Employment Impact
- **Cannot be company director**: Automatic disqualification
- **Financial services**: Significant restrictions
- **Legal profession**: May lose practicing certificate
- **Accountancy**: Professional body rules apply
- **Police/Armed forces**: May be dismissed
- **Charity trustees**: Cannot serve
- **Licensed premises**: May lose license

**Reality**: Much more employment risk with bankruptcy

### 7. Public Record and Privacy

#### IVA Publicity
**Listed on**:
- Individual Insolvency Register (public)
- Online and searchable
- Remains for 3 months after completion

**NOT listed in**:
- Local newspapers
- The Gazette
- Employer notifications (unless you tell them)

**Visibility**: Low - most people won't find out

#### Bankruptcy Publicity
**Listed on**:
- Individual Insolvency Register (public)
- The Gazette (national publication)
- Online forever (gazette records)

**May be discovered by**:
- Current employer (if they check)
- Professional bodies (often automatic notification)
- Anyone searching public records

**Visibility**: Higher - more public than IVA

### 8. Creditor Approval

#### IVA Creditor Approval
- **Required**: YES
- **Threshold**: 75% by debt value must approve
- **Voting**: Only those who respond to proposal
- **Can be rejected**: Yes, if offer too low or terms unacceptable

**Risk**: Creditors may reject proposal

#### Bankruptcy Creditor Approval
- **Required**: NO
- **Cannot be stopped**: Creditors cannot prevent bankruptcy
- **Guaranteed outcome**: Will be made bankrupt if you apply

**Risk**: No rejection risk (but lose control)

- You can pay £680 upfront (or get help)
- You want certainty of outcome
- You've had IVA rejected

- All three UK nations resident → Check eligibility for all options

## Common Questions

**Q: Is bankruptcy worse than IVA for credit?**
A: Both appear on credit file for 6 years. Bankruptcy may be viewed slightly worse, but practical difference is small.

**Q: Can I get a mortgage after IVA vs bankruptcy?**
A: Timeline is similar - difficult for 3-4 years after IVA, 4-5 years after bankruptcy.

**Q: What if my IVA is rejected by creditors?**
A: You can revise the proposal, consider bankruptcy, or try a DMP.

**Q: Can I switch from IVA to bankruptcy or vice versa?**
A: Yes, but IVA fees already paid are not refundable. You can't switch from bankruptcy to IVA once bankrupt.

**Q: Which is easier to get approved?**
A: Bankruptcy is guaranteed if you apply and pay £680. IVAs need creditor approval.

**Q: If I fail my IVA, can I go bankrupt?**
A: Yes. Your IP may petition for your bankruptcy if you breach the IVA terms.

**Q: Can creditors make me bankrupt if I'm in an IVA?**
A: No, the IVA protects you from bankruptcy petitions (unless you breach the IVA).

## Key Takeaway

**Neither solution is universally "better"** - the right choice depends on your specific circumstances:

- **IVAs protect assets** but require long commitment and regular payments
- **Bankruptcy is quicker and cheaper** but you may lose assets

Most people with assets to protect and regular income choose IVAs. Those with few assets and low income often find bankruptcy more suitable.

**The most important step**: Get professional advice to understand which solution works best for YOUR situation.
