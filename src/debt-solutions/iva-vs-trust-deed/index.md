## IVA vs Scottish Trust Deed - What's the Difference?

If you're researching debt solutions in the UK, you've likely encountered both Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVAs) and Trust Deeds (also called Protected Trust Deeds or PTDs). These are similar formal debt solutions, but there's one crucial difference: **geography**.

- **IVA**: England, Wales, and Northern Ireland
- **Trust Deed**: Scotland only

While they serve the same purpose - a formal agreement to repay debts over time with the remainder written off - the legal frameworks differ significantly.

## Quick Comparison Table

| Feature | IVA (England/Wales/NI) | Trust Deed (Scotland) |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Availability** | England, Wales, Northern Ireland | Scotland only |
| **Legal Framework** | Insolvency Act 1986 | Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 2016 |
| **Minimum Debt** | £6,000+ (unofficial) | £5,000+ (unofficial) |
| **Duration** | 60 months (5 years) | 48 months (4 years) |
| **Creditor Approval** | 75% by value | All creditors (protected status) |
| **Failed Protection** | 75% majority still binds | Automatic if criteria met |
| **Practitioner Title** | Insolvency Practitioner (IP) | Trustee |
| **Fee Structure** | Nominee + supervisor fees | Trustee fees (similar %) |
| **Payment Review** | Annual reviews | Regular reviews |
| **Public Register** | Individual Insolvency Register | Register of Insolvencies (ROI) |
| **Equity Release** | Year 5 | Year 4 |
| **Credit Impact** | 6 years | 6 years |

## Geographic Eligibility

### Where You Must Live

**For an IVA**:
- Permanently resident in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland
- Must have lived there for at least 6 months
- Court jurisdiction: England and Wales

**For a Trust Deed**:
- Permanently resident in Scotland
- Scottish legal jurisdiction applies
- Cannot be used elsewhere in UK

**What if I move?**

**Scotland to England during agreement**:
- Trust Deed continues under Scottish law
- Remains valid
- Completed in Scotland even if you've moved

**England to Scotland during IVA**:
- IVA continues under English law
- Remains valid
- Managed from England

### Northern Ireland Special Case

Northern Ireland residents can use:
- ✅ IVA (England and Wales insolvency law applies)
- ❌ Not Trust Deed
- Alternative: Debt Relief Order (Northern Ireland version)

## Duration Difference - 4 Years vs 5 Years

### Standard Terms

**Trust Deed**: **48 months (4 years)**
- Shorter standard term
- Year 4: Equity release review
- Completion typically month 48

**IVA**: **60 months (5 years)**
- Longer standard term
- Year 5: Equity release review
- Completion typically month 60

**IVA extension to 72 months**:
- If can't release equity
- Becomes 6 years total

**Trust Deed extension to 60 months**:
- If can't release equity
- Becomes 5 years total

### Total Payment Comparison

**Example: £500/month payment**

| Solution | Standard Term | Extended (no equity) | Total Paid Standard | Total Paid Extended |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Trust Deed** | 48 months | 60 months | £24,000 | £30,000 |
| **IVA** | 60 months | 72 months | £30,000 | £36,000 |

**Implication**: Trust Deed = pay £6,000 less over standard term

## Creditor Approval Process

### IVA Approval (England/Wales)

**Requires 75% creditor approval**:

**Creditors' meeting**:
- All creditors invited to vote
- Need 75% by debt value to approve
- Each £1 of debt = 1 vote
- Meeting can be virtual

**Example**:
```
Total debt: £30,000
Creditors voting:
- Creditor A: £15,000 (votes yes)
- Creditor B: £10,000 (votes yes)
- Creditor C: £5,000 (votes no)

Total yes: £25,000 / £30,000 = 83.3%
Result: IVA APPROVED ✅
```

**If less than 75%**: IVA fails, no protection

### Trust Deed Protected Status (Scotland)

**Automatic protection if criteria met**:

**Protected Trust Deed criteria**:
1. All creditors notified properly
2. 5-week objection period
3. If creditors representing less than ⅓ of debt object = PROTECTED
4. If more than ⅓ object = NOT PROTECTED

**Example**:
```
Total debt: £30,000
Objections period:
- Creditor A: £15,000 (no objection)
- Creditor B: £10,000 (no objection)
- Creditor C: £5,000 (objects)

Objecting debt: £5,000 / £30,000 = 16.7%
Under ⅓ threshold (33.3%)
Result: PROTECTED TRUST DEED ✅
```

**Key difference**: Trust Deed uses **negative consent** (assumes yes unless object)

**If not protected**:
- Can continue as voluntary trust deed
- No legal protection
- Creditors can still pursue
- Most people abandon if not protected

## Fee Structure Comparison

### IVA Fees (England/Wales)

**Two-stage fees**:

1. **Nominee Fee**: £1,000-£2,000
   - Setting up IVA
   - Proposal preparation
   - Creditors' meeting

2. **Supervisor Fee**: 15-20% of payments
   - Ongoing management
   - Annual reviews
   - Distribution to creditors

**Example IVA fee calculation**:
```
Payment: £400/month for 60 months
Total paid: £24,000

Nominee fee: £1,500 (from first payments)
Supervisor fee: 18% × £24,000 = £4,320
Total fees: £5,820

To creditors: £18,180
```

### Trust Deed Fees (Scotland)

**Trustee fees**:
- Similar percentage (15-20%)
- No separate nominee fee
- Taken from contributions
- Paid monthly as percentage

**Example Trust Deed fee calculation**:
```
Payment: £400/month for 48 months
Total paid: £19,200

Trustee fee: 18% × £19,200 = £3,456

To creditors: £15,744
```

**Fee comparison on £400/month**:

| Duration | Total Paid | Fees (18%) | To Creditors |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Trust Deed (48m)** | £19,200 | £3,456 | £15,744 |
| **IVA (60m)** | £24,000 | £5,820 | £18,180 |

**Trust Deed = lower total fees** (shorter term)

## Process Timeline Comparison

### IVA Timeline (England/Wales)

**Week 1-2**: Initial consultation with IP
- Financial assessment
- Debt analysis
- IVA suitability

**Week 3-4**: Proposal preparation
- Detailed proposal document
- Statement of affairs
- Creditor pack prepared

**Week 5-6**: Creditors' meeting
- Proposal sent to creditors
- 14 days to consider
- Virtual meeting or decision procedure
- 75% vote needed

**Week 7+**: If approved
- IVA begins
- First payment due
- Legal protection starts

**Total to approval**: 6-8 weeks typically

### Trust Deed Timeline (Scotland)

**Week 1-2**: Initial consultation with Trustee
- Financial assessment
- Debt analysis
- Trust Deed suitability

**Week 3-4**: Trust Deed prepared
- Deed documentation
- Statement of affairs
- Creditor notification

**Week 5-9**: 5-week objection period
- All creditors notified
- Creditors can object
- Monitor objection levels

**Week 10+**: Protected status
- If less than ⅓ objected = PROTECTED
- Legal protection starts
- First payment begins

**Total to protection**: 8-10 weeks typically

**Key difference**: Trust Deed takes slightly longer due to 5-week objection period

## Home Equity Comparison

### IVA Equity Release (Year 5)

**Timing**: Month 54-60 (year 5)

**Process**:
1. Property valuation arranged
2. Equity calculated
3. Remortgage attempts
4. If successful: Lump sum paid to IVA
5. If unsuccessful: 12-month extension (72 months total)

**Equity calculation**:
```
Property value: £250,000
Mortgage: £180,000
Gross equity: £70,000
85% remortgage limit: £212,500
Available to borrow: £32,500
May need to pay: £32,500 OR extend 12 months
```

### Trust Deed Equity Release (Year 4)

**Timing**: Month 42-48 (year 4)

**Process**:
1. Property valuation
2. Equity review
3. Remortgage consideration
4. If equity release possible: Paid to Trust Deed
5. If not possible: Usually 12-month extension (60 months total)

**Calculation similar**: 
- 85% loan-to-value typical limit
- Equity above this may need releasing
- Extension alternative if can't remortgage

**Key difference**: Happens 1 year earlier in Trust Deed

## Payment Review Frequency

### IVA Annual Reviews

**Once per year**:
- Review income changes
- Review expenses
- Adjust payment if needed

**Income increase**:
- 50% of increase goes to IVA typically
- Reviewed at anniversary

**Income decrease**:
- Payment reduced if affordable
- Supported with evidence

### Trust Deed Regular Reviews

**Regular reviews** (frequency varies):
- Some trustees review annually
- Some review more frequently
- Income changes trigger reviews

**Similar principles**:
- Income increases = higher payment
- Income decreases = potential reduction
- Must keep trustee informed

**Slight advantage**: Trust Deed process can be more flexible

## Public Record Comparison

### IVA - Individual Insolvency Register

**What's published**:
- Your name and address
- IP name and contact
- IVA start date
- Case number

**Duration on register**:
- Added when IVA approved
- Remains until 3 months after completion
- Searchable by public

**Website**: [www.gov.uk/individual-insolvency-register](https://www.gov.uk/individual-insolvency-register)

### Trust Deed - Register of Insolvencies

**What's published**:
- Your name and address
- Trustee details
- Protected status
- Date granted

**Duration on register**:
- Added when Trust Deed registered
- Remains until 5 years after completion
- Searchable by public

**Website**: Accountant in Bankruptcy (AiB) Register

**Key difference**: Trust Deed stays on register **longer** after completion

## Credit Impact Comparison

### Both Solutions: 6 Years

**Credit file impact**:
- **IVA**: Recorded for 6 years from start date
- **Trust Deed**: Recorded for 6 years from start date

**Example timeline**:
```
Trust Deed starts: January 2026
Completes: January 2030 (4 years)
Removed from credit file: January 2032 (6 years from start)
Still on file: 2 years after completion

IVA starts: January 2026
Completes: January 2031 (5 years)
Removed from credit file: January 2032 (6 years from start)
Still on file: 1 year after completion
```

**Practical difference**:
- Trust Deed: Off credit file sooner after completion (2 years vs 1 year)
- Both still 6 years total from start date

### Credit Score Impact

**During agreement**:
- Both severely impact credit score
- Credit very difficult to obtain
- Similar restrictions

**After completion**:
- Trust Deed: Clean credit file 2 years post-completion
- IVA: Clean credit file 1 year post-completion
- Can start rebuilding during waiting period

## Employment Impact Comparison

### IVA Employment Restrictions

**Roles affected**:
- Chartered accountant
- Insolvency practitioner
- Some financial services roles
- Some company director positions
- Charity trustee

### Trust Deed Employment Restrictions

**Similar restrictions**:
- Chartered accountant
- Insolvency practitioner
- Some financial services roles
- Some company director positions

**Scottish-specific considerations**:
- Scottish public sector roles may have policies
- Local government positions

**No major difference**: Both affect similar professions

## Cost Comparison Example

### Real-World Scenario

Monthly payment: £350
Total paid: £16,800
Trustee fees (18%): £3,024

### Trust Deed Advantages

✅ **Shorter standard term**: 4 years vs 5 years  
✅ **Pay less overall**: Due to shorter term  
✅ **Easier approval**: Negative consent (⅓ objection threshold)

✅ **Quicker to debt-free**: 12 months sooner

### IVA Advantages

✅ **More established**: Longer history in England/Wales  
✅ **Clear approval process**: 75% vote is definitive  
✅ **Wider availability**: England, Wales, Northern Ireland
