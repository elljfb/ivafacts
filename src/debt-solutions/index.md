## Choosing the Right Debt Solution

While an IVA can be an effective debt solution for many people, it's not the only option available. Understanding the alternatives helps you make the best decision for your unique financial situation.

## Main Debt Solution Alternatives

### 1. Bankruptcy

A formal insolvency process that writes off most unsecured debts, typically within 12 months.

**Best for**: Those with little income, few assets, and significant debts

### 2. Debt Relief Order (DRO)

Often called "bankruptcy light" - a simpler, cheaper option for people with low income and minimal assets.

**Best for**: Those with debts under £30,000, less than £75 monthly surplus income, and assets worth less than £2,000

### 3. Debt Management Plan (DMP)

An informal arrangement to repay your debts in full through reduced monthly payments.

**Best for**: Those who want to repay debts in full but need more time and reduced payments

### 4. Scottish Trust Deed

The Scottish equivalent of an IVA, available only to residents of Scotland.

**Best for**: Scottish residents with debt over £5,000
