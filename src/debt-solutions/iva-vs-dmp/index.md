## IVA vs DMP: Which Debt Solution is Right for You?

IVAs and Debt Management Plans (DMPs) are both ways to repay your debts through affordable monthly payments. However, one is legally binding (IVA) and the other is informal (DMP). Understanding the differences is crucial.

## Quick Comparison Table

|--------|-----|-----|
| **Legal Status** | Legally binding | Informal arrangement |
| **Debt Write-Off** | Yes (after 5-6 years) | No (pay in full) |
| **Duration** | Fixed: 5-6 years | Variable (until paid in full) |
| **Creditor Protection** | Yes (legal protection) | No (goodwill only) |
| **Cost** | £5,000-£8,000 in fees | £0-£2,100 (may be free) |
| **Interest/Charges** | Frozen by law | Frozen if creditors agree |
| **Can Creditors Refuse?** | Need 75% approval initially | Can refuse participation |
| **Can Creditors Change Mind?** | No (bound by agreement) | Yes (can demand more/sue) |
| **Monthly Payment Changes** | Annual reviews only | Can change anytime |
| **Minimum Debt** | £6,000+ | Any amount |
| **Credit Impact** | 6 years on credit file | While active + 6 years |

| **Creditor Contact** | Stopped | May continue |

## What is a Debt Management Plan (DMP)?

A DMP is an **informal arrangement** where you make reduced monthly payments to your creditors based on what you can afford.

**Key features**:
- Not legally binding
- Creditors can refuse to participate
- Debts repaid in full (no write-off)
- Can be free through charities
- Flexible - can change or cancel
- No legal protection

## Detailed Comparison

### 1. Legal Status

#### IVA - Legally Binding

**Once approved**:
- Legally binding contract
- Creditors bound by agreement
- Cannot pursue you
- Cannot add interest/charges
- Cannot take legal action
- Must accept the terms

**Protection**: Full legal protection from day one

**Commitment**: Cannot easily cancel or change

#### DMP - Informal Agreement

**No legal force**:
- Based on creditor goodwill
- Creditors can refuse to participate
- Creditors can withdraw at any time
- Can continue adding interest (if they choose)
- Can still pursue legal action
- No obligation to accept reduced payments

**Protection**: None - relies on creditor cooperation

**Commitment**: Can cancel or change anytime

**KEY DIFFERENCE**: IVA provides legal protection; DMP relies on creditor goodwill

### 2. Debt Write-Off

#### IVA Debt Write-Off

**After completion** (5-6 years):
- Remaining qualifying debt written off
- Typically 60-70% of original debt forgiven
- Legally discharged from debts
- Completion certificate issued

**Example**:
- Original debt: £30,000
- Paid over 5 years: £12,000 (including fees)
- Written off: £18,000 ✅

#### DMP No Write-Off

**Must pay in full**:
- No debt written off
- Pay 100% of debt (plus any interest not frozen)
- May take 5-15+ years to complete
- No completion certificate (just paid off)

**Example**:
- Original debt: £30,000
- Must pay: Full £30,000
- Plus interest if not frozen
- Written off: £0 ❌

**KEY DIFFERENCE**: IVA writes off remaining debt; DMP requires full repayment

### 3. Duration

#### IVA Duration

**Fixed term**: 60-72 months (5-6 years)

**Certainty**:
- Know exact end date
- Cannot extend beyond 72 months (unless modification)
- Complete on schedule if payments maintained

**Example**:
- Debt: £25,000
- Payment: £200/month
- IVA term: 60 months
- End date: Known from day one
- Debt at end: Remaining written off

#### DMP Duration

**Variable term**: Until debt paid in full

**Uncertainty**:
- Length depends on payment amount
- Could be 3 years or 20+ years
- Can extend if payments reduced
- No guaranteed end date

**Example**:
- Debt: £25,000
- Payment: £200/month
- If interest frozen: 125 months (10.4 years)
- If 10% APR continues: 191 months (15.9 years)
- End date: Unknown, varies with interest

**KEY DIFFERENCE**: IVA is 5-6 years fixed; DMP length varies greatly

### 4. Interest and Charges

#### IVA Interest

**Frozen by law**:
- All interest stopped from approval
- No additional charges
- Debt amount fixed
- Cannot increase

**Protection**: Guaranteed by law

**Example**:
- Debt at start: £20,000
- After 5 years: Still £20,000 (what you haven't repaid)
- Interest added: £0 ✅

#### DMP Interest

**Depends on creditor agreement**:
- Most creditors freeze interest IF you ask
- Some may refuse
- Can restart interest if they choose
- No legal requirement

**Protection**: None - reliant on creditor goodwill

**Example - Interest Frozen**:
- Debt at start: £20,000
- After 5 years: £20,000 minus payments
- Interest added: £0 ✅ (if agreed)

**Example - Interest Continues**:
- Debt at start: £20,000 at 18% APR
- After 5 years: £20,000 + interest - payments
- Interest added: £1000s ❌ (much longer to repay)

**KEY DIFFERENCE**: IVA guarantees interest freeze; DMP interest freeze is voluntary

### 5. Cost Comparison

#### IVA Costs

**Total typical cost**: £5,000-£8,000

**Fees**:
- Nominee fee: £1,000-£2,000
- Supervisor fee: 15-20% of each payment
- Built into payments (not extra)

**Example**:
- Monthly payment: £200
- Over 60 months: £12,000
- Fees: £3,000 (25%)
- To creditors: £9,000 (75%)

**Upfront**: £0

#### DMP Costs

**Free DMPs** (many options):
- StepChange: Free
- National Debtline: Free
- PayPlan: Free
- Christians Against Poverty: Free

**Paid DMPs**:
- Setup fee: £0-£50
- Monthly fee: £25-£35
- Over 60 months: £1,500-£2,100

**Example - Free DMP**:
- Monthly payment: £200
- Over 60 months: £12,000
- Fees: £0
- To creditors: £12,000 (100%)

**Example - Paid DMP**:
- Monthly payment: £200
- Fee: £30/month
- To creditors: £170/month
- Over 60 months: £10,200 to creditors, £1,800 fees

**Upfront**: Usually £0

**KEY DIFFERENCE**: Free DMPs are cheaper than IVAs, but DMPs don't write off debt

### 6. Value Comparison

#### IVA Value

**Total benefit**:
```
Original debt: £30,000
IVA payments: £12,000 (inc. £3,000 fees)
To creditors: £9,000
Debt written off: £21,000
Net benefit: £18,000 debt relief (after fees)
```

**Value**: Pay less than owed, debt written off

#### DMP Value

**Total cost**:
```
Original debt: £30,000
DMP payments: £30,000 (no write-off)
Fees: £0-£2,100
To creditors: £30,000 (or £27,900 if paid DMP)
Debt written off: £0
Net benefit: £0 debt relief (pay in full)
```

**Value**: Pay everything owed

**KEY DIFFERENCE**: IVA writes off substantial debt; DMP pays in full

### 7. Creditor Cooperation

#### IVA Creditor Involvement

**Initial approval**: Must get 75% of creditors (by value) to approve

**After approval**:
- All creditors bound (even those who voted no)
- Cannot refuse participation
- Cannot demand more
- Cannot take legal action
- Must accept terms

**Guarantee**: Once approved, locked in

#### DMP Creditor Involvement

**Initial setup**: Ask creditors to participate

**Ongoing**:
- Each creditor chooses whether to participate
- Can withdraw participation anytime
- Can refuse reduced payments
- Can demand full payment
- Can take legal action
- Can add charges

**No guarantee**: Relies on goodwill throughout

**KEY DIFFERENCE**: IVA locks creditors in; DMP creditors can withdraw

### 8. Flexibility

#### IVA Flexibility

**Low flexibility**:
- Fixed monthly payment
- Can only change at annual review
- Need IP approval for changes
- Cannot cancel easily
- Cancellation = failure (fees kept, no debt written off)

**Benefits of rigidity**:
- Structured approach
- Forces discipline
- Clear end goal

#### DMP Flexibility

**High flexibility**:
- Can increase payments anytime
- Can reduce payments if circumstances change
- Can take payment breaks
- Can cancel with no penalty
- Can switch to another solution
- Can pay off early

**Benefits of flexibility**:
- Adapts to life changes
- No penalty for improvement
- Can cancel if circumstances improve

**KEY DIFFERENCE**: IVA is rigid; DMP is flexible

### 9. Credit Impact

#### IVA Credit Impact

**On credit file**: 6 years from start date

**Severity**: Severe negative impact

**Accounts marked**: "Arrangement to pay" or "IVA"

**Public record**: Yes (Insolvency Register)

**Timeline**:
- Years 1-6: IVA on file
- Year 6: Removed
- Years 6-8: Recovery
- Years 8+: Normalizing

#### DMP Credit Impact

**On credit file**: While active + 6 years after each account settled

**Severity**: Moderate to severe negative impact

**Accounts marked**: "Arrangement to pay" or "default" (if missed payments before DMP)

**Public record**: No

**Timeline**:
- Years 1-X: DMP active, "arrangement" on file
- Year cleared: Start of 6-year clock
- 6 years after cleared: Removed

**Potential longer impact**: If DMP takes 10 years, then +6 years = 16 years total credit impact

**BOTH DAMAGE CREDIT**: IVA is 6 years fixed; DMP potentially longer

### 10. Minimum Debt

#### IVA Minimum Debt

**Typical minimum**: £6,000

**Why**:
- Fees make smaller IVAs uneconomical
- Below £6,000, fees could be 50%+ of payments
- Not cost-effective

**Example - Too small**:
- Debt: £4,000
- IVA fees: £2,000
- To creditors: £2,000
- Written off: £2,000
- Not worth it ❌

#### DMP Minimum Debt

**No minimum**: Any amount

**Suitable for**:
- £1,000+
- £5,000+
- £10,000+
- Any debt amount

**Example - Small debt OK**:
- Debt: £4,000
- DMP fees: £0 (free DMP)
- To creditors: £4,000
- Repays in full ✅

**KEY DIFFERENCE**: DMPs suitable for smaller debts; IVAs need £6,000+

### 11. When Creditors Don't Cooperate

#### IVA Non-Cooperation

**Before approval**:
- If less than 75% approve, IVA rejected
- Can modify proposal and try again
- Or try different solution

**After approval**:
- All creditors bound
- Cannot refuse to cooperate
- Have no choice

#### DMP Non-Cooperation

**Anytime**:
- Creditors can refuse to participate
- Can withdraw cooperation
- Can demand full payment
- Can take legal action
- Can add interest

**Common issues**:
- Some creditors continue calling
- Some refuse reduced payments
- Some issue CCJs
- Some use debt collectors

**No protection** if creditors don't cooperate

**KEY DIFFERENCE**: IVA forces cooperation; DMP doesn't

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I switch from DMP to IVA?**  
A: Yes, anytime. Payments made under DMP count toward debt but won't be refunded.

**Q: Can I switch from IVA to DMP?**  
A: Only if IVA fails. You lose all fees paid and debt isn't written off. Don't recommend.

**Q: Which is better for credit score?**  
A: Both damage credit severely. IVA impact is 6 years fixed. DMP could be longer if takes many years to repay.

**Q: Can I get a mortgage after IVA vs DMP?**  
A: Similar difficulty for 3-4 years. IVA removed after 6 years; DMP depends on repayment length.

**Q: Do I need a debt charity for DMP or can I DIY?**  
A: You can DIY by contacting creditors yourself and arranging reduced payments. Debt charities help with negotiations and distribution but not required.

**Q: Will creditors always accept a DMP?**  
A: No. Some creditors refuse reduced payments, especially if they think you can afford more. No legal requirement to participate.

**Q: If my DMP creditors keep adding interest, should I switch to IVA?**  
A: Possibly. If interest makes DMP unworkable and you qualify for IVA, it may be better (interest frozen by law).

**Q: Can I have both IVA and DMP?**  
A: No. You choose one solution for all your qualifying debts.

**Q: Which is more likely to be approved - IVA or DMP?**  
A: DMPs don't need approval (you just start). IVAs need 75% creditor approval, but properly prepared proposals usually succeed.
