## IVA Frequently Asked Questions

Find quick answers to common questions about Individual Voluntary Arrangements. Questions are organized by topic.

## General IVA Questions

### What is an IVA?

An Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) is a formal, legally binding agreement between you and your creditors to repay your debts over a fixed period (typically 5-6 years). After completion, remaining qualifying debt is written off.

[Read full IVA guide →](/what-is-an-iva/)

### How does an IVA work?

You work with a licensed Insolvency Practitioner (IP) to create a proposal outlining affordable monthly payments. If 75% of your creditors (by debt value) approve, you make payments for 5-6 years, then remaining debt is written off.

[See IVA process →](/iva-process/)

### Who is eligible for an IVA?

To qualify, you typically need:
- £6,000+ unsecured debt
- Regular income
- Ability to pay £80-100+ monthly
- Live in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland
- 2+ creditors

[Check your eligibility →](/calculators/eligibility/)

### How much debt do you need for an IVA?

The typical minimum is **£6,000** in unsecured debt. Below this, fees make IVAs uneconomical. There's no upper limit, though IVAs typically handle debts up to £75,000-£100,000.

### Can I get an IVA with less than £6,000 debt?

It's unlikely. Most Insolvency Practitioners won't accept IVAs below £6,000 because fees would consume too much of payments. Consider a Debt Management Plan instead.

### How long does an IVA last?

**Standard duration**: 5-6 years (60-72 months)
- Most IVAs: 60 months (5 years)
- If equity release fails: Extended to 72 months (6 years)
- Early completion possible with lump sum payment

## IVA Eligibility Questions

### Can I get an IVA if I'm unemployed?

Generally no. IVAs require regular income to make monthly payments. If you're unemployed, consider:
- Debt Relief Order (if debts under £30,000)
- Bankruptcy
- Wait until employed and reconsider

### Can I get an IVA if I'm self-employed?

**Yes!** Self-employed individuals can get IVAs. You'll need to provide:
- 6+ months of trading history
- Accounts or tax returns
- Bank statements
- Evidence of consistent income

IVAs allow self-employed people to continue trading, unlike bankruptcy.

### Can I get an IVA if I'm on benefits?

It depends which benefits:

**May be acceptable**:
- Disability benefits (PIP, DLA)
- Carer's Allowance
- Employment + benefits
- Working Tax Credits

**Usually not acceptable alone**:
- Jobseeker's Allowance
- Universal Credit (basic rate)
- Income Support
- ESA only

### Can I get an IVA if I rent my home?

**Yes!** Being a renter doesn't disqualify you. In fact, it simplifies the process as there's no equity release requirement in year 5.

### Can I include my partner's debts in my IVA?

**No.** Only debts in your name (or joint names) can be included in your IVA. Your partner would need their own separate IVA for their individual debts.

### Can I get an IVA with a CCJ?

**Yes!** Having a County Court Judgment doesn't prevent IVA eligibility. In fact, an IVA stops further court action and includes CCJ debts.

### Can I get an IVA in Scotland?

**No.** IVAs are not available in Scotland. Scottish residents should consider:
- **Trust Deed**: Scottish equivalent of IVA
- **Debt Arrangement Scheme (DAS)**: Protected debt repayment program
- Bankruptcy (Scottish "Sequestration")

## IVA Process Questions

### How do I start an IVA?

1. Contact a licensed Insolvency Practitioner
2. Free initial consultation
3. Provide financial information
4. IP prepares proposal
5. Proposal sent to creditors
6. Creditors vote
7. If approved (75%+), IVA begins

[Detailed process guide →](/iva-process/)

### How long does it take to set up an IVA?

**Typical timeline**: 6-12 weeks
- Week 1-2: Initial consultation and information gathering
- Week 3-6: Proposal preparation
- Week 7-9: Creditors' meeting and voting
- Week 10+: IVA begins after approval

Delays can occur if information is incomplete or creditors request modifications.

### Do I have to go to court for an IVA?

**No.** IVAs don't involve court. Everything is handled by your Insolvency Practitioner and creditors. Creditors' meetings are virtual (no physical attendance required).

### What happens at a creditors' meeting?

**You don't attend!** The meeting is virtual:
- Creditors receive proposal 14 days before
- They vote by post/email/online
- Meeting conducted by your IP
- 75% (by debt value) must approve
- Results sent to you after

### What if creditors reject my IVA?

If rejected, you can:
- Modify proposal and resubmit
- Offer higher monthly payments
- Include lump sum
- Consider bankruptcy
- Try Debt Management Plan
- Negotiate directly with creditors

Your IP will advise on next steps.

### Can creditors make me pay more in an IVA?

**During proposal**: Creditors can request modifications (higher payments, longer term). You must agree to any changes.

**After approval**: Creditors cannot demand more unless your circumstances change and annual review shows increased income.

## IVA Payments Questions

### How much will my IVA payments be?

Payments are based on **disposable income**:
```
Monthly Income
MINUS Essential Expenditure
= Disposable Income (your IVA payment)
```

Typical payments: £80-£500/month depending on circumstances.

[Calculate your payment →](/calculators/monthly-payment/)

### Can I afford an IVA?

If you have £80-£100+ left after essential expenses each month, you can likely afford an IVA. Your IP will assess affordability based on your full financial situation.

### What if I can't afford my IVA payments?

If you genuinely can't afford payments:

**Temporary issues**:
- Request payment break (usually 1-3 months)
- Provide evidence of hardship
- Resume payments after

**Permanent reduction**:
- Annual review can reduce payments
- Must show reduced income/increased expenses
- Extension of term may be required

**Unable to continue**:
- IVA may fail
- All fees paid are kept
- Creditors can pursue you again
- Bankruptcy may follow

### Can my IVA payments go up?

**Yes**, during annual reviews if:
- Your income increases
- Essential expenses decrease
- You haven't disclosed income
- Circumstances improve

**Cannot increase if**:
- Circumstances unchanged
- Expenses increased justifiably
- Income reduced

### Can I pay off my IVA early?

**Yes!** You can complete early by:
- Paying lump sum to settle remaining debt
- Usually need to pay 100% of remaining debt
- Requires creditor approval
- Your IP arranges this

**Common sources**: Inheritance, property sale, gift from family

### What happens if I miss an IVA payment?

**One missed payment**:
- Contact IP immediately
- Explain reason
- Arrange to catch up
- Usually no serious consequences

**Multiple missed payments**:
- IVA at risk of failure
- IP may terminate IVA
- Creditors can pursue you again
- May petition for bankruptcy

**Always** contact your IP before missing payments.

## IVA Restrictions Questions

### Can I get credit during an IVA?

**Cannot borrow over £500 without IP permission**

**Reality**: Even with permission, lenders rarely approve credit during an IVA. Your credit rating is severely damaged.

**Alternatives**:
- Prepaid cards (use own money)
- Authorized overdraft (with IP permission)
- Borrow under £500 (still requires permission)

### Can I have a bank account during an IVA?

**Yes!** You keep your bank account unless:
- The bank is also a creditor (may freeze account)
- You switch to different bank to avoid issues

**Basic bank accounts** are available if needed. These don't allow overdrafts.

### Can I get a mortgage during an IVA?

**Extremely difficult.** Most lenders won't approve mortgages during IVAs.

**If approved** (very rare):
- Specialist lenders only
- Very high interest rates (10%+)
- Large deposits required (40%+)
- May affect IVA compliance

**Better to**: Wait until after IVA completion (or 1-2 years after).

### Can I go on holiday during an IVA?

**Yes**, but consider:
- Must maintain IVA payments
- Holiday must be affordable within budget
- Cannot borrow to fund holiday
- Reasonable holidays are acceptable

**Excessive spending**: May affect IVA if creditors become aware

**Best practice**: Budget for modest holidays from disposable income.

### Can I get a mobile phone contract during an IVA?

**Difficult but possible**:
- SIM-only contracts easier (no phone)
- Phone contracts harder (£500+ credit)
- Need IP permission if includes expensive phone
- May need to pay upfront or use PAYG

### Can I move house during an IVA?

**Yes**, but must:
- Inform your IP immediately
- Ensure new rent is affordable
- Any rental deposit needs IP approval if reduces payments
- Moving costs must be reasonable

**Buying property**: Very difficult during IVA (see mortgage question above).

## IVA and Assets Questions

### Will I lose my home in an IVA?

**Usually no.** IVAs are designed to protect homes. However:

**Year 5 requirement**:
- Must attempt to release equity (remortgage)
- If successful: Equity goes to IVA, completes early/on time
- If unsuccessful: Extend IVA by 12 months

**Rarely lose home** unless:
- Cannot maintain mortgage payments
- Voluntarily sell
- Breach IVA terms

### Will I lose my car in an IVA?

**Usually no.** Cars are typically protected if:
- Reasonable value (up to £2,000-£5,000)
- Essential for work
- Only household vehicle
- Not a luxury vehicle

**May need to downgrade if**:
- Luxury or high-value vehicle
- Not essential
- IP considers excessive

### What assets can I keep in an IVA?

**Generally keep**:
- Your home (with equity release requirements)
- Reasonable car
- Household furniture and belongings
- Tools of trade
- Essential items
- Pensions

**May need to sell**:
- Second properties
- Expensive jewelry
- Luxury items
- Collections with significant value
- Non-essential vehicles

### What about my pension in an IVA?

**Pensions are protected.** They're not considered assets in IVAs and cannot be accessed by creditors.

**However**: If you're receiving pension income, it counts toward your IVA payment calculations.

### Can I save money during an IVA?

**Limited savings allowed**:
- Small emergency fund (£500-£1,000) usually acceptable
- Savings for specific purposes (Christmas, car repairs)
- Must be reasonable and disclosed

**Large savings**: May indicate you can afford higher IVA payments.

### What about an inheritance during my IVA?

**Inheritances are windfalls** and must be disclosed:
- Usually must contribute to IVA
- Often 100% goes to IVA
- Can complete IVA early
- Requires creditor agreement

**Small inheritances** (under £500): Case-by-case basis.

## IVA Impact Questions

### How does an IVA affect my credit rating?

**Severe negative impact**:
- IVA recorded on credit file
- Stays for 6 years from start date
- Credit score drops significantly
- Difficult to get credit for 6+ years

[Detailed credit impact →](/what-is-an-iva/credit-score/)

### Will my employer find out about my IVA?

**Probably not**, unless:
- You tell them
- They check Insolvency Register
- Your profession requires disclosure
- You work in financial services

**No automatic notification** to employers.

### Can I be a company director with an IVA?

**Usually yes**, but check:
- Your company's Articles of Association
- Some restrict directors with IVAs
- Professional body rules (if applicable)
- Ongoing ability to fulfill duties

**Much better than bankruptcy** (which automatically disqualifies directors).

### Does an IVA affect my partner?

**Your partner is NOT affected unless**:
- You have joint debts (they remain fully liable)
- Their income is considered in your IVA affordability
- You own property jointly (may affect equity release)

**Their credit file**: Completely separate, not affected.

### Will an IVA affect my job?

**Most jobs unaffected.** Restrictions mainly for:
- Financial services roles
- Some police roles
- Armed forces (may be discharged)
- Certain professional bodies
- Roles with financial responsibility

**Check**: Your employment contract and professional body rules.

### Can I be refused an IVA?

**Yes, creditors can reject if**:
- Offer is too low
- They'd get more from bankruptcy
- Information is incomplete
- Terms are unreasonable
- You don't meet basic criteria

**Typical approval rate**: 85-95% of properly prepared proposals are approved.

## IVA Completion Questions

### What happens when my IVA is completed?

**Upon successful completion**:
1. Final payment made
2. IP distributes to creditors
3. Completion certificate issued
4. Remaining debt legally written off
5. IVA ends

**Your obligations end** and you're debt-free (for included debts).

### How do I get my IVA completion certificate?

Your IP issues this automatically after:
- All payments made
- Any equity release completed
- Final distribution to creditors
- Usually within 6-8 weeks of final payment

**Keep this safe** - proof of completion.

### How long after completion does IVA leave my credit file?

**6 years from START date**, not completion date.

**Example**:
- IVA starts: January 2020
- IVA completes: January 2025 (5 years)
- Removed from credit file: January 2026 (6 years from start)

### What debts are written off in an IVA?

**Included and written off**:
- Credit cards
- Personal loans
- Overdrafts
- Store cards
- Payday loans
- Catalogue debt
- Some HMRC debts

**NOT written off**:
- Secured debts (mortgage, car finance)
- Student loans
- Court fines
- Child maintenance
- Debts obtained fraudulently
- Debts not disclosed in proposal

### Can I get credit after my IVA?

**Immediately after**: Still difficult as IVA on credit file

**After 6 years**: IVA removed, credit improves

**Timeline**:
- Years 0-6: IVA on file, very difficult
- Years 6-8: IVA removed, gradual improvement
- Years 8+: Credit normalizing

## IVA Failure Questions

### What happens if my IVA fails?

**Consequences of IVA failure**:
- All fees paid are kept (not refunded)
- No debt is written off
- Creditors can pursue you again
- May face bankruptcy petition
- Legal protection ends

**Common reasons for failure**:
- Missing multiple payments

### Can I get another IVA if my first one fails?

**Yes**, you can apply for a new IVA, but:
- Must address reasons for first failure
- Creditors may be skeptical
- May require better terms
- Not guaranteed approval

**Better**: Do everything to make first IVA succeed.

### What percentage of IVAs fail?

Approximately **25-30% of IVAs fail** before completion. Main reasons:
- Job loss
- Illness
- Relationship breakdown
- Non-compliance

**Success rate**: 70-75% successfully complete.

## IVA vs. Other Solutions Questions

### IVA vs. bankruptcy - which is better?

**Depends on circumstances**:

**IVA better if**:
- You own a home
- You have assets to protect
- You're self-employed or a director
- You have regular income

**Bankruptcy better if**:
- Few/no assets
- Low/no income
- Need quick solution (12 months vs 5-6 years)
- Can pay £680 upfront

[Detailed comparison →](/debt-solutions/iva-vs-bankruptcy/)

### IVA vs. DMP - which should I choose?

**IVA advantages**:
- Legal protection from creditors
- Debt write-off after term
- Cannot be canceled by creditors

**DMP advantages**:
- More flexible
- No legal commitment
- Can pay off early without creditor approval
- Less credit impact

[Detailed comparison →](/debt-solutions/iva-vs-dmp/)

### What is a Debt Relief Order? Is it better than an IVA?

**DRO** is for those with:
- Debts under £30,000
- Less than £75 monthly surplus income
- Assets under £2,000
- Costs only £90

**DRO is better if you qualify** (lower cost, quicker). But most with £6,000+ debt and regular income won't qualify.

[IVA vs DRO comparison →](/debt-solutions/iva-vs-dro/)

## IVA Costs and Fees Questions

### How much does an IVA cost?

**Total typical cost**: £5,000-£8,000 over the IVA term

**Breakdown**:
- Nominee fee: £1,000-£2,000 (setup)

**Important**: Fees are built into your monthly payment, not charged separately.

- £0 upfront cost
- Fees taken from your monthly payments

- Then supervisor fee from each payment

### Are IVA fees refundable if it fails?

**No.** If your IVA fails:
- All fees paid are kept by the IP

Fees cover:
- Initial consultation and assessment
