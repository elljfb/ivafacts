## IVA Consequences - What Really Changes?

An Individual Voluntary Arrangement isn't just a financial agreement - it affects multiple aspects of your daily life for 5-6 years. Understanding these consequences before you start helps you prepare and avoid surprises.

## Quick Overview of IVA Consequences

| Area | Impact Level | Duration |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Credit Rating** | Severe | 6 years |
| **Home Ownership** | Moderate-High | Years 5-6 |
| **Employment** | Low-Moderate | During IVA |
| **Bank Account** | Low | During IVA |
| **Borrowing** | Severe | During IVA + 3-4 years after |
| **Privacy** | Moderate | During IVA |
| **Lifestyle** | Moderate | During IVA |
| **Relationships** | Variable | Depends on circumstances |

## 1. Home and Property Consequences

### If You Own Your Home

**Year 1-4**: Your home is generally protected. You continue making mortgage payments as normal.

**Year 5**: **Equity release requirement** - the biggest consequence for homeowners.

**What happens**:
- Your IP will value your property
- Calculate equity (value minus mortgage)
- You must try to release equity to pay creditors

**Equity release options**:
1. **Remortgage**: Borrow against equity (if you qualify)
2. **Third party payment**: Family/friend pays lump sum
3. **12-month extension**: If can't release, IVA extends to 72 months

**Example scenario**:
```
Property value: £250,000
Mortgage: £180,000
Equity: £70,000

85% remortgage limit: £212,500
New mortgage: £212,500
Equity available: £32,500

May need to pay £32,500 to IVA or extend 12 months
```

**Can't remortgage?** Common reasons:
- Credit damaged by IVA
- Income insufficient
- Lender policies
- Property type issues

**Result**: IVA extends 12 months (72 months total) instead

### Joint Ownership

**If you own with partner**:
- Only your share of equity considered
- Partner not required to remortgage
- But may need their cooperation
- Can cause relationship strain

**Example - 50/50 ownership**:
```
Property value: £300,000
Mortgage: £200,000
Total equity: £100,000
Your share (50%): £50,000
```

### Renting

**If you rent**: No home equity consequences

**Benefits**:
- No equity release requirement
- No 12-month extension risk
- IVA remains 60 months

### Homeowner vs Renter IVA Comparison

| Factor | Homeowner | Renter |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Standard duration** | 60 months | 60 months |
| **Year 5 equity release** | Required | N/A |
| **Extension risk** | High | None |
| **Actual duration** | Often 72 months | 60 months |
| **Complexity** | Higher | Lower |
