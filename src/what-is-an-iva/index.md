## Understanding Individual Voluntary Arrangements

An **Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)** is a formal, legally binding agreement between you and your creditors to pay back your debts over a set period, typically 5-6 years. It's one of several debt solutions available in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

### How an IVA Works

When you enter an IVA:

1. You work with a licensed **Insolvency Practitioner (IP)** who helps you create a proposal
2. Your IP calculates what you can realistically afford to pay each month
3. The proposal is sent to your creditors for approval
4. If 75% (by debt value) of voting creditors agree, the IVA is approved and binds all creditors
5. You make one monthly payment to your IP, who distributes it to your creditors
6. After completing the agreement (usually 5-6 years), remaining qualifying debt is written off

### Key Features of an IVA

- **Legally binding**: Protects you from creditor action once approved
- **Fixed term**: Typically 60-72 months
- **Affordable payments**: Based on your disposable income
- **Interest frozen**: Creditors cannot add more interest or charges
- **Debt write-off**: Remaining debt is written off after completion
- **One monthly payment**: Simplified debt management
