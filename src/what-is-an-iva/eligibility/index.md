## IVA Eligibility Requirements

To enter an Individual Voluntary Arrangement, you must meet specific criteria. Understanding these requirements helps determine if an IVA is a viable option for your situation.

## Core Eligibility Criteria

### 1. Minimum Debt Level

**Requirement**: Typically **£6,000 or more** in unsecured debt

#### Why £6,000?
- Below this, fees make IVAs uneconomical
- Most IPs won't accept lower amounts
- Other solutions (DMPs) more cost-effective for smaller debts

#### What Counts as Unsecured Debt?

**✅ Included**:
- Credit card balances
- Personal loans
- Overdrafts
- Store cards
- Payday loans
- Catalogue debt
- Council tax arrears
- Utility bill arrears
- HMRC debts (some)

**❌ NOT Included**:
- Mortgages (secured on property)
- Car finance (secured on vehicle)
- Student loans
- Court fines
- Child maintenance arrears
- Social fund loans
- Debts obtained fraudulently

### 2. Regular Income

**Requirement**: Consistent, provable income source

#### Acceptable Income Sources

**✅ Accepted**:
- Employment (PAYE)
- Self-employment income
- Pension income
- Disability benefits (PIP, DLA)
- Carer's allowance
- Working tax credits
- Child benefit (in some cases)

**❌ Generally NOT Accepted**:
- Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) only
- Universal Credit (basic rate only)
- Income Support only
- Employment Support Allowance (ESA) only

**Important**: You can combine benefit and employment income.

#### Self-Employed Considerations

Self-employed individuals can get IVAs if:
- Business has traded for 6+ months
- Can provide accounts/tax returns
- Income is reasonably consistent
- Can demonstrate affordability

### 3. Minimum Disposable Income

**Requirement**: Usually **£80-£100+ per month** available for IVA payments

#### What is Disposable Income?

**Formula**:
```
Total Monthly Income
MINUS Essential Expenditure
= Disposable Income
```

#### Essential Expenditure Includes:
- Housing costs (rent/mortgage)
- Council tax
- Utilities (gas, electric, water)
- Food and housekeeping
- Transport costs
- Insurance (contents, life, etc.)
- Basic clothing
- Essential communications (phone, internet)
- School costs
- Childcare costs
- Healthcare costs

#### Non-Essential Spending:
- Sky TV / premium subscriptions
- Gym memberships
- Eating out regularly
- Holidays
- Luxury items
- Excessive entertainment

**Note**: IPs assess whether spending is reasonable for household size and circumstances.

### 4. Number of Creditors

**Requirement**: Generally **2 or more creditors**

#### Why Multiple Creditors?
- IVAs are formal agreements between you and your creditors
- With one creditor, informal arrangements often preferable
- Fees make single-creditor IVAs inefficient

#### Exception:
Some IPs may accept single creditors if:
- Debt is substantial (£15,000+)
- Creditor is litigious
- Alternatives have failed
- Bankruptcy would have worse consequences

### 5. Residency Requirements

**Requirement**: Resident in **England, Wales, or Northern Ireland**

#### Geographic Restrictions

**✅ IVAs Available**:
- England
- Wales
- Northern Ireland

**❌ IVAs NOT Available**:
- Scotland (Scottish Trust Deeds instead)
- Outside UK (other jurisdictions)

#### Proof of Residency:
- Utility bills
- Council tax bills
- Bank statements
- Tenancy agreement or mortgage statement

### 6. Age Requirements

**Requirement**: Must be **18 years or older**

No upper age limit exists, but considerations for:
- **Under 18**: Cannot enter IVA
- **Elderly**: Affordability over 5-6 years must be realistic
- **Pension age**: Viable if pension income sufficient

### 7. Creditor Approval Threshold

**Requirement**: **75% of voting creditors** (by debt value) must approve

#### How Voting Works:
- Creditors receive your proposal
- They vote within 14 days
- Voting power based on debt amount owed
- Non-voters don't count

**Example**:
- Total debt: £20,000
- Creditors voting: £15,000 worth
- Need to approve: £11,250 worth (75% of voting)

#### Common Reasons for Rejection:
- Offer too low (creditors get less than bankruptcy)
- Insufficient disposable income
- Unrealistic budget
- Asset values underestimated
- Missing information

### 8. Employment Restrictions

**Some professions have restrictions**:

#### May Affect IVA Eligibility:
- Certain financial services roles
- Police officers (disclosure required)
- Armed forces personnel
- Some legal professions
- Company directors (restrictions)
- Charity trustees
- Licensed premises managers

**Action**: Check your employment contract and professional body rules.

## Detailed Eligibility Assessment

### Debt-to-Income Ratio

While no official ratio exists, IPs typically look for:

**Ideal Profile**:
- Debt: £6,000 - £75,000
- Monthly income: £1,200+
- Disposable income: £100-£500
- Debt-to-income ratio: 3-5 years of income

**Example 1: Good Candidate**
- Debt: £18,000
- Income: £1,600/month
- Expenses: £1,400/month
- Disposable: £200/month
- Result: ✅ Strong candidate

**Example 2: Marginal Candidate**
- Debt: £8,000
- Income: £1,100/month
- Expenses: £1,030/month
- Disposable: £70/month
- Result: ⚠️ Borderline (may not be viable)

**Example 3: Poor Candidate**
- Debt: £4,500
- Income: £900/month
- Expenses: £900/month
- Disposable: £0/month
- Result: ❌ Not suitable for IVA

### Asset Considerations

#### Homeownership

**Owning property doesn't disqualify you**, but:

**Year 5 Requirement**:
- Must attempt equity release
- Remortgage to release equity toward IVA
- If successful: IVA completes early
- If unsuccessful: Extend IVA by 12 months

**Equity Calculation**:
```
Property Value: £200,000
Mortgage Owed: £160,000
Your Share: 50% (joint ownership)
Your Equity: £20,000
Amount to release: £20,000 or extend
```

#### Vehicle Ownership

**Cars are generally protected if**:
- Worth less than £2,000
- Essential for work
- Only household vehicle
- Disability-related need

**Expensive vehicles**:
- May need to be sold
- Replaced with cheaper alternative
- Equity released into IVA

#### Other Assets

**Protected**:
- Essential household furniture
- Tools of trade
- Items under £500 value
- Wedding rings

**May Need Sale**:
- Second properties
- Investment portfolios
- Valuable jewelry
- Boats, caravans, motorcycles
- Collectibles with significant value

## Special Circumstances

### Joint Debts

If you have joint debts:

**Your options**:
1. Both partners enter separate IVAs
2. You enter IVA; partner pays debt
3. Negotiate to split debt
4. Joint IVA (rare, complex)

**Important**: Co-borrower remains 100% liable even if you enter an IVA.

### Business Owners

**Sole Traders**:
- ✅ Can enter IVA
- Business continues
- Business debts included
- Personal and business finances combined

**Company Directors**:
- ⚠️ May need to resign

### Homemakers with No Income

If you're a homemaker:

**Challenges**:
- No disposable income
- Cannot afford IVA payments

**Potential Solutions**:
- Partner contributes to payments
- Take on part-time work
- Consider DRO instead (if eligible)
- Wait until returning to work

### Zero-Hours Contracts

**Can qualify if**:
- Average income is sufficient
- Income relatively consistent
- Can evidence 3-6 months income
- Understand payments may fluctuate

**IPs will**:
- Review annual reviews more carefully
- May require higher buffer
- Adjust payments if income drops

### Seasonal Workers

**Possible but challenging**:

- Partner's income may help
- Payments based on annual average
- More frequent reviews

## Common Eligibility Questions

**Q: Can I include debts in my partner's name?**  
A: No. Only debts in your name (or joint names) can be included.

**Q: Will my partner need to enter an IVA too?**  
A: Only if they have their own unmanageable debts. Your IVA doesn't affect them unless debts are joint.

**Q: Can I get an IVA with a CCJ or bailiff action?**  
A: Yes. An IVA stops most creditor actions including CCJs and bailiffs (once approved).

**Q: Does bad credit prevent IVA eligibility?**  
A: No. Your credit score doesn't affect IVA eligibility. Income and debt levels matter most.

**Q: Can I include tax debts?**  
A: Usually yes, including VAT, PAYE, and self-assessment arrears. HMRC is treated like other creditors.

**Q: What if I've already tried to negotiate with creditors?**  
A: That's fine. Failed negotiations don't affect IVA eligibility.

**Q: Can I enter an IVA while pregnant or on maternity leave?**  
A: Yes, if you meet financial criteria. Income will be reviewed when you return to work.
