## Understanding the IVA Journey

Getting an Individual Voluntary Arrangement involves several key stages. This guide walks you through each step so you know exactly what to expect.

## The 6 Stages of an IVA

### Stage 1: Initial Assessment

The journey begins with understanding whether an IVA is right for you.

**What happens**:
- Review your financial situation
- List all debts and creditors
- Document your income and expenditure
- Explore whether an IVA is the best solution

**Duration**: 1-2 weeks

### Stage 2: Choosing an Insolvency Practitioner (IP)

You must work with a licensed IP to set up an IVA. Choose carefully.

**What happens**:
- Research licensed IPs
- Compare fees and services
- Have initial consultations
- Select your IP

**Key considerations**:
- Is the IP licensed and regulated?
- What are their fees?
- Do they explain things clearly?
- What is their success rate?

**Duration**: 1-2 weeks

### Stage 3: Proposal Preparation

Your IP helps you create a formal proposal to present to your creditors.

**What happens**:
- Detailed financial assessment
- Calculate affordable monthly payment
- Draft IVA proposal document
- Include assets, income, and circumstances
- Submit to creditors

**Documents needed**:
- Proof of income (payslips, tax returns)
- Bank statements (3-6 months)
- Bills and expenditure evidence
- Details of all debts
- Property valuation (if homeowner)

**Duration**: 2-4 weeks

### Stage 4: Creditors' Meeting

Your creditors vote on whether to accept your IVA proposal.

**What happens**:
- Creditors receive your proposal
- They have 14 days to consider it
- Virtual meeting held (you typically don't attend)
- Creditors vote on acceptance
- Modifications may be suggested

**Approval requirements**:
- 75% of voting creditors (by debt value) must approve
- Non-voting creditors are bound by the decision
- Modifications require your agreement

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks

### Stage 5: Living With Your IVA

Once approved, you'll live with the IVA for typically 5-6 years.

**What happens**:
- Make monthly payments to your IP
- Annual income and expenditure reviews
- Report significant changes (income, address, circumstances)
- Possibly release equity from property (if homeowner)
- Avoid taking new credit over £500

**Your responsibilities**:
- ✅ Make payments on time every month
- ✅ Cooperate with annual reviews
- ✅ Notify IP of changes
- ✅ Live within the agreed budget
- ❌ Don't miss payments
- ❌ Don't borrow without permission
- ❌ Don't hide income or assets

**Duration**: 60-72 months (5-6 years)

### Stage 6: Completion or Failure

Your IVA reaches its conclusion - either successful completion or failure.

**Successful Completion**:
- Make all agreed payments
- Complete any equity release requirements
- Receive completion certificate
- Remaining qualifying debts are written off
- IVA removed from register after 3 months

**IVA Failure**:
- If you breach terms (miss payments, hide income, etc.)
- IP may petition for your bankruptcy
- Creditors can pursue debts again
- All payments made are kept by creditors

**After completion**:
- IVA marker on credit file for 6 years from start
- Begin rebuilding credit
- Financial freedom restored
