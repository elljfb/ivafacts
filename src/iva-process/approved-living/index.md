## Living with an Approved IVA - The Reality

Your IVA has been approved - congratulations on taking this major step. Now begins the 5-6 year journey of living within your IVA terms. This guide covers everything you need to know about managing your IVA successfully, from monthly payments to annual reviews, and how to handle life changes along the way.

## The First Month - Getting Started

### Setting Up Payments

**Payment method options**:

**Standing order** (most common):
- You control payment
- Set up with your bank
- Must remember to pay
- Your responsibility

**Direct debit**:
- Automatic payment
- IP controls
- Never miss payment
- Less control

**Manual payment**:
- Bank transfer each month
- Must remember
- Easy to miss
- Not recommended

**Recommended**: Direct debit for reliability

### First Payment Amount

**Often higher than ongoing**:
```
Example:
Agreed monthly payment: £300
Nominee fee: £1,500

Payment schedule:
Month 1-5: £600/month (includes £300 nominee fee portion)
Month 6-60: £300/month

OR

Month 1: £1,800 (includes full nominee fee)
Month 2-60: £300/month
```

**Know your schedule**: IP provides payment breakdown

### What Happens with Your Payment

**Your £300 payment goes**:
```
Received by IP: £300
Held in client account
Monthly:
- Supervisor fee taken: £54 (18%)
- To creditors' pot: £246
- Administrative costs: Included in supervisor fee

Quarterly distribution to creditors:
Accumulated funds distributed pro-rata
```

**Pro-rata distribution example**:
```
Funds available: £3,000 (quarter's payments)
Total debt: £40,000

Creditor A (£20,000): Gets £1,500 (50%)
Creditor B (£15,000): Gets £1,125 (37.5%)
Creditor C (£5,000): Gets £375 (12.5%)
```

### Creditor Contact Stops

**Within 2-4 weeks**:
- ✅ Phone calls cease
- ✅ Letters stop
- ✅ Email chasing ends
- ✅ Doorstep collectors withdraw
- ✅ Court action halted

**If creditor still contacts you**:
- Don't engage
- Refer them to your IP
- Give IP name and reference
- Don't make direct payments

**Relief**: Most people describe this as the biggest immediate benefit

## Living Within Your IVA Budget

### Your Approved Budget

**From your proposal**:
```
Example Budget:
Income: £2,100/month

Expenses:
Mortgage/rent: £700
Council tax: £130
Utilities: £150
Food: £450
Transport: £180
Insurance: £60
Clothing: £70
Childcare: £180
Phone/internet: £45
Other: £135

Total expenses: £2,100
Less IVA payment: -£300
Disposable remaining: £0
Living budget: £1,800/month
```

**This is your spending limit**

### Allowed vs Not Allowed

**Expenses you can have**:

✅ **Housing**: Mortgage/rent, council tax, home insurance

✅ **Utilities**: Gas, electric, water, basic phone/internet

✅ **Food**: Reasonable housekeeping for household size

✅ **Childcare**: Essential childcare for work

✅ **Healthcare**: Prescriptions, necessary medical costs

✅ **Clothing**: Reasonable clothing budget

✅ **Education**: Essential school costs

**Restricted or not allowed**:

❌ **Holidays abroad**: Need IP permission, must save from budget

❌ **Gym memberships**: Unless medical necessity

❌ **Sky/premium TV**: Basic packages only

❌ **Expensive phone contracts**: £30-40/month maximum typically

❌ **Dining out regularly**: Occasional only

❌ **Multiple subscriptions**: Netflix/Amazon/Spotify - choose one or two

❌ **New car purchase**: Without IP permission

❌ **Luxury spending**: Designer goods, expensive hobbies

### Practical Budgeting Tips

**1. Track every penny** (first 3 months)
- Use app (Money Dashboard, Emma)
- Keep receipts
- Review weekly
- Identify overspending

**2. Meal planning**
- Plan weekly meals
- Bulk cook
- Reduce food waste
- £50-80/week for family achievable

**3. Reduce utilities**
- Switch providers (before IVA this counts as credit application, but now you're in IVA you can switch)
- Energy-saving habits
- Consider water meter
- Budget billing schemes

**4. Transport savings**
- Lift sharing
- Walk short journeys
- Maintain vehicle (prevents expensive repairs)
- Shop around for insurance annually

**5. Entertainment on budget**
- Free activities (parks, walks, libraries)
- Cancel unnecessary subscriptions
- Stream rather than cinema
- Picnics instead of restaurants

**6. Build tiny emergency fund**
- With IP permission
- £500-£1,000 maximum
- True emergencies only
- From cutting expenses, not income

### What If Budget Is Too Tight?

**If genuinely struggling**:
1. Contact IP immediately (don't wait)
2. Explain situation
3. Provide evidence
4. Request budget review

**IP may**:
- Increase expense allowance
- Reduce payment temporarily
- Offer payment break
- Adjust budget at next review

**Don't suffer in silence** - communicate early

## Annual Reviews - What to Expect

### Purpose of Annual Reviews

**Every 12 months, IP reviews**:
- Current income
- Current expenses
- Any changes in circumstances
- Payment affordability
- Whether adjustment needed

**Required by IVA terms**: Not optional

### Timeline

**Review schedule**:
```
IVA approved: March 2026
Review 1: March 2027 (12 months)
Review 2: March 2028 (24 months)
Review 3: March 2029 (36 months)
Review 4: March 2030 (48 months)
Review 5: March 2031 (60 months + equity release)
```

**IP will contact you** 1-2 weeks before review due

### What You'll Need to Provide

**Income evidence**:
- ✅ Last 3 months payslips (if employed)
- ✅ Updated tax return (if self-employed)
- ✅ Benefit award letters (if changed)
- ✅ Bank statements (3 months)
- ✅ Any new income sources

**Expense evidence**:
- ✅ Updated utility bills
- ✅ Current rent/mortgage statement
- ✅ Council tax (if amount changed)
- ✅ Any significant expense changes

**Change evidence**:
- ✅ New employment letter
- ✅ Redundancy notice
- ✅ Benefit changes
- ✅ Family changes (birth, death, divorce)

### Review Format

**Methods**:
- **Telephone**: Most common (30-45 minutes)
- **Video call**: Increasingly popular
- **Face-to-face**: Rare now
- **Email/portal**: For simple updates

**What happens**:
1. IP asks about income changes
2. Reviews expense changes
3. Discusses any issues
4. Calculates new disposable income
5. Determines if payment changes
6. Confirms for next 12 months

### Income Changes and Payment Adjustments

**The 50% rule**:

**If income increases**:
```
Previous income: £2,000/month
Current income: £2,400/month
Increase: £400/month

50% of increase to IVA: £200/month

New payment:
Previous: £300/month
Addition: £200/month
New payment: £500/month
```

**If income decreases**:
```
Previous income: £2,000/month
Current income: £1,700/month
Decrease: £300/month

Previous payment: £300/month
New affordable payment: £150/month (based on new budget)

IP may reduce payment to £150/month
```

**Varies by IVA terms**: Some IVAs have different formulas

### Common Review Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Payrise**
```
Annual payrise: £1,200/year (£100/month)
50% to IVA: £50/month
New payment: £350/month (from £300)
Effective income increase to you: £50/month
```

**Scenario 2: Promotion**
```
Salary increase: £5,000/year (£417/month)
50% to IVA: £208/month
New payment: £508/month (from £300)
Significant payment increase
But better than bankruptcy or DMP
```

**Scenario 3: Job Loss**
```
Previous: Employment £2,000/month
Current: Universal Credit £1,200/month
Previous payment: £300/month
New calculation: £50/month (or payment break)
IP supports through difficulty
```

**Scenario 4: New Baby**
```
New dependent
Increased expenses (childcare, food, clothing)
Potential income decrease (maternity leave)
Payment likely reduced
Review acknowledges family changes
```

**Scenario 5: Partner Moves In**
```
Household income increases (if sharing bills)
OR expenses decrease (shared housing costs)
May increase disposable income
Payment might increase
Be honest about living arrangements
```

## Income Windfalls - What Happens?

### Types of Windfalls

**Covered by most IVAs**:

**1. Inheritance**
- Goes to IVA (typically 100%)
- Must declare immediately
- Cannot decline to avoid paying
- Even if from close family

**2. Bonuses**
- Work bonuses: 50-100% to IVA (depends on terms)
- Must declare
- Usually 50% unless IVA specifies different

**3. Commission**
- Regular commission: Part of normal income
- One-off commission: May count as windfall
- Discuss with IP

**4. Tax refunds**
- Usually goes 100% to IVA
- IP may request directly from HMRC
- Rare exceptions for overpayment errors

**5. Lottery/gambling wins**
- Anything over £500: Goes to IVA
- Under £500: Usually yours to keep
- Check your specific terms

**6. Redundancy payments**
- Complicated situation
- Statutory redundancy: Protected portion
- Enhanced redundancy: May go to IVA
- IP assesses case-by-case

**7. Gifts**
- Small gifts (birthday, Christmas): Usually fine
- Large gifts (£500+): May go to IVA
- Must declare substantial gifts

**8. Compensation/PPI**
- Goes to IVA typically
- Even if relates to debts in IVA
- IP distributes to creditors

### Windfall Examples

**Example 1: Inheritance**
```
Grandfather passes away
You inherit £15,000
Must declare to IP immediately
£15,000 paid to IVA
Distributed to creditors
May allow IVA early completion if enough
```

**Example 2: Work Bonus**
```
Annual bonus: £2,000
IVA terms: 50% of bonuses
To IVA: £1,000
You keep: £1,000 (less tax)
```

**Example 3: Lottery Win**
```
Win £5,000 on lottery
Must declare
£5,000 goes to IVA
May reduce remaining IVA term
```

### Why Windfalls Go to IVA

**The principle**:
- You agreed to pay what you can afford
- Windfalls = money you can afford
- Fair to creditors
- Part of IVA terms

**Exception**: Small gifts/amounts under threshold

## Life Changes During IVA

### Moving House

**Can you move?** Yes, with conditions

**Must inform IP**:
- Before moving
- New address
- New housing costs
- Impact on budget

**Considerations**:

**If costs increase**:
```
Current rent: £700/month
New rent: £900/month
Increase: £200/month
Impact: Payment may decrease £200/month
```

**If costs decrease**:
```
Current rent: £700/month
New rent: £600/month
Decrease: £100/month
Impact: Payment might increase £100/month
```

**Moving abroad**: Usually not allowed without IP permission

### Changing Jobs

**Can you change jobs?** Yes, freely

**Must inform IP**:
- Before if possible (or immediately after)
- New employer details
- New salary
- Start date

**Impact on payments**:
- Higher salary: Payment may increase (50% rule)
- Lower salary: Payment may decrease
- Similar salary: Payment likely unchanged

**Career progression**: Encouraged, not penalized (though payments adjust)

### Unemployment

**Lost your job?**
1. Inform IP immediately
2. Provide evidence (redundancy letter, P45)
3. Apply for benefits
4. Request payment break or reduction

**IP will**:
- Assess new income (benefits)
- Calculate affordable payment
- May grant 3-6 month payment break
- Support you through difficulty

**Payment break**:
```
Previous payment: £300/month
Unemployed: 3-month payment break (£0/month)
IVA extended: 3 months
New end date: 63 months instead of 60
```

**Back to work**: Resume payments, inform IP of new job

### Relationship Changes

**Marriage/moving in with partner**:
- May affect household expenses
- Might increase or decrease payment
- Must declare change

**Separation/divorce**:
- May significantly impact finances
- Often reduces ability to pay
- IP will review sympathetically
- Payment usually reduced

**New baby**:
- Additional expenses
- Potential income reduction (maternity)
- Payment typically reduced
- Declare immediately

### Illness or Injury

**Unable to work due to health**:
1. Inform IP with medical evidence
2. Apply for relevant benefits (ESA, PIP)
3. Request payment adjustment
4. Provide doctor's note

**IP will**:
- Review based on benefit income
- May reduce payment significantly
- May grant payment break
- Support through recovery

**Terminal illness**: May allow early IVA completion

## Credit and Borrowing During IVA

### The £500 Rule

**IVA typically allows**:
- Borrow up to £500 without IP permission
- But approval still unlikely from lenders
- Still on credit file

**Over £500**:
- Must request IP permission
- Usually denied unless essential
- E.g., car finance for essential transport

### Reality of Borrowing

**Very difficult to get credit**:
- IVA on credit file
- Credit score very low
- Most lenders auto-decline
- Even guarantor loans difficult

**Possible (but not recommended)**:
- Some payday lenders (high rates)
- Some guarantor loans
- Some credit unions (small amounts)

**Violates IVA if**:
- Over £500 without permission
- Can result in IVA failure
- Creditors can challenge

**Best approach**: Avoid borrowing entirely

### Credit Cards

**Existing cards**: All cancelled as part of IVA

**New cards**: Can't get during IVA

**After IVA**: Wait 1-2 years post-completion, then:
- Credit builder cards
- Secured cards
- Low limits initially

### Bank Accounts

**Current account**:
- Can keep existing (usually)
- Basic account likely
- New accounts difficult

**Switching banks**:
- Can be done
- May need to explain IVA
- Some banks decline

**Recommended banks for IVA customers**:
- Monzo (often accepts)
- Starling (often accepts)
- Basic bank accounts (most banks)

### Mortgages

**Existing mortgage**:
- ✅ Continue as normal
- Part of essential expenses
- Won't be affected

**Remortgaging**:
- Very difficult during IVA
- Usually only for equity release (year 5)
- Specialist brokers only
- High interest rates

**New mortgage**:
- Impossible during IVA
- Wait 3-4 years after completion
- Need larger deposit (25-40%)
- Limited lenders

## Equity Release - Year 5 (Homeowners)

### The Process

**Timing**: Months 54-60 (year 5)

**What happens**:
1. **Month 54**: IP orders property valuation
2. **Valuation**: Professional surveyor assesses property
3. **Calculation**: Equity determined
4. **Month 55-58**: Remortgage attempts
5. **Month 59-60**: Release equity OR agree 12-month extension

### Equity Calculation

**Example**:
```
Property value: £280,000
Existing mortgage: £190,000
Gross equity: £90,000

85% remortgage limit: £238,000
Maximum new mortgage: £238,000
Current mortgage: £190,000
Available to borrow: £48,000

Amount expected to release: £48,000
(Or extend IVA 12 months)
```

### Remortgage Challenges

**Why remortgage often fails**:
- ❌ Credit damaged by IVA
- ❌ Income insufficient for higher mortgage
- ❌ Lender policies exclude IVA customers
- ❌ Property type issues
- ❌ Age (if near retirement)

**Remortgage specialists**:
- IVA-friendly lenders exist
- Higher interest rates (2-5% above standard)
- May charge higher fees
- IP usually has contacts

### Extension Alternative

**If genuinely can't remortgage**:
```
Standard IVA: 60 months
Unable to release equity: Extend 12 months
New term: 72 months total
Additional payments: 12 × monthly payment

Example:
£300/month × 12 months = £3,600 additional
Instead of £48,000 equity release
```

**Most homeowners extend** - more common than successful remortgage

### Third-Party Contribution

**Alternative to remortgage or extension**:
- Family member pays lump sum
- Replaces equity release requirement
- IVA completes at 60 months

**Example**:
```
Required equity: £48,000
Parent offers: £20,000
Remaining: £28,000
Options:
1. Smaller extension (7-8 months)
2. Increase monthly payment
3. Combination
```

**Generous option** if family can help

## Communication with Your IP

### How Often Should You Contact IP?

**Regular contact**:
