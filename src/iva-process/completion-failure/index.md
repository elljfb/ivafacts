## IVA Completion & Failure - The Endings

Every IVA journey ends in one of two ways: successful completion or failure. Understanding both outcomes helps you work toward completion and know what happens if circumstances force failure. This guide covers the completion process, life after IVA, and the realities of IVA failure.

## Successful IVA Completion

### What is Completion?

**IVA completion means**:
- ✅ All agreed payments made
- ✅ All terms fulfilled
- ✅ Equity release completed (or extension served)
- ✅ IP confirms obligations met
- ✅ Completion certificate issued
- ✅ Remaining debt legally written off

**Standard timeline**: 60 months (5 years) or 72 months (6 years if extended)

### The Final Months (Months 58-60)

**Month 58**: Preparation
- IP reviews your case
- Confirms all payments received
- Checks all terms complied with
- Prepares for completion

**Month 59**: Final review
- Equity release confirmed (if homeowner)
- All documents in order
- Outstanding issues resolved
- Final payment confirmed

**Month 60**: Final payment
- Make your last payment
- Often emotional moment
- 5-6 years of commitment culminating

**Months 60-61**: Processing
- IP prepares completion documents
- Notifies creditors
- Arranges certificate
- Updates records

### Completion Certificate

**What you receive**:

**Certificate of Completion**:
- Official document from IP
- States IVA successfully completed
- Lists completion date
- Confirms debts written off
- Legal proof of completion

**Received**: Usually within 4-6 weeks of final payment

**Keep safe**: Proof you completed IVA

**Example certificate content**:
```
CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION
Individual Voluntary Arrangement

This certifies that:
Name: Sarah Smith
Address: 123 Main Street, Town
IVA Reference: SS12345

Has successfully completed her Individual Voluntary 
Arrangement which commenced on 15th March 2026 and 
was completed on 15th March 2031.

Total paid to creditors: £18,500
Remaining unsecured debt written off: £21,500

Signed: [IP signature]
Date: 30th March 2031
Insolvency Practitioner License: 12345
```

### What Gets Written Off

**Debts included in IVA**:
- All unsecured debts listed in proposal
- Interest and charges accrued before IVA
- Debts owed to creditors who voted

**Example write-off**:
```
Original debt: £40,000
Paid through IVA: £18,500 (including fees)
To creditors: £14,800
Written off: £25,200 (63%)
```

**Write-off is legal and permanent** - creditors cannot chase

### Debts NOT Written Off

**Excluded debts** (still owe):
- ❌ Secured loans (mortgage - but normal payments continued)
- ❌ Student loans
- ❌ Court fines
- ❌ CSA/CMS child maintenance
- ❌ TV license fines (criminal penalty)
- ❌ Parking fines (some)
- ❌ Debts incurred after IVA start
- ❌ Debts not declared in IVA

**You must continue paying these** after IVA completion

### Creditor Notification

**IP notifies all creditors**:
- IVA completed
- No further payments coming
- Debt written off (their portion)
- Remove from collections

**Creditors must**:
- Mark debt as settled (IVA)
- Stop all collection activity
- Update their records
- Report completion to credit agencies

### Insolvency Register Removal

**Individual Insolvency Register**:
- IVA listed while active
- **Removed 3 months after completion**
- No longer searchable publicly

**Timeline**:
```
IVA completed: March 2031
Register entry: Until June 2031 (3 months)
Removed: June 2031
```

**After removal**: IVA not on public register (but still on credit file until 6 years from start)

## Life After IVA Completion

### Credit File Impact Timeline

**The 6-year rule**:

**IVA starts**: March 2026  
**Credit file marker**: Added immediately  
**IVA completes**: March 2031 (60 months)  
**Credit file marker**: Remains until March 2032 (6 years from start)

**Time on credit file after completion**: 1-2 years typically

**Example timeline**:
```
Year 0 (2026): IVA starts - credit score plummets
Year 1-5 (2026-2031): Active IVA - credit very poor
Year 5 (2031): Complete IVA - marker still showing
Year 6 (2032): IVA removed from credit file - starts improving

Total: 6 years from IVA start date
```

### Credit Score Recovery

**Expected trajectory**:

**During IVA** (years 0-5):
- Credit score: 200-400 (very poor)
- No credit available
- Can't get mortgage
- Struggle for bank account

**Completion to 1 year after** (year 5-6):
- Credit score: 300-500 (poor)
- Limited credit available
- Credit builder cards possible
- Basic accounts available

**1-2 years after completion** (years 6-7):
- Credit score: 500-650 (fair)
- Some credit cards available
- Personal loans (high interest)
- Improving but challenging

**2-3 years after completion** (years 7-8):
- Credit score: 600-750 (fair-good)
- More credit options
- Better interest rates
- Mortgage possible (high deposit)

**3+ years after completion** (years 8+):
- Credit score: 700-900 (good-excellent)
- Normal credit access
- Competitive rates
- Mortgage more accessible

**Individual variation**: Depends on rebuilding efforts

### Rebuilding Credit - Step by Step

**Year 5-6** (IVA just completed):

**Step 1: Check credit file**
- Get reports from all 3 agencies (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion)
- Verify IVA debts marked correctly (satisfied/settled)
- Check completion recorded
- Dispute any errors

**Step 2: Get on electoral roll**
- Register to vote at address
- Boosts credit score
- Proves address stability

**Step 3: Open basic bank account**
- If don't already have
- Shows banking relationship
- Many banks now accept post-IVA

**Year 6-7** (IVA off credit file):

**Step 4: Credit builder card**
- Designed for poor credit
- Low limit (£200-500)
- High interest (don't carry balance)
- Use and pay off monthly

**Examples**:
- Vanquis credit builder card
- Aqua credit card
- Capital One credit builder

**Usage strategy**:
```
Month 1: Spend £50, pay off in full
Month 2: Spend £50, pay off in full
Month 3: Spend £50, pay off in full
...continue 12 months
Result: Positive payment history = credit score boost
```

**Step 5: Credit builder loan**
- Loan where you receive funds after payments
- Small loan (£500-1,000)
- Make monthly payments
- Receive amount at end
- Builds payment history

**Step 6: Joint credit (carefully)**
- If partner has good credit
- Joint account or card
- Their credit boosts yours
- But links you financially

**Year 7-8** (2-3 years post-completion):

**Step 7: Upgrade credit products**
- Better credit cards
- Standard (not builder) cards
- Personal loans
- Lower interest rates

**Step 8: Save deposit for mortgage**
- Need 25-40% deposit typically
- Start saving aggressively
- Improves mortgage prospects

**Step 9: Use credit sparingly**
- Don't max out cards
- Under 30% utilization
- Builds credit responsibly

**Year 8+** (3+ years post-completion):

**Step 10: Apply for mortgage**
- Use specialist broker
- Expect higher rates initially
- Larger deposit required (25-40%)
- Some lenders will consider

**Step 11: Continue good habits**
- Pay everything on time
- Keep credit utilization low
- Don't apply for too much credit
- Build financial stability

### Employment After IVA

**Most professions**: No longer restricted

**Previously affected roles**:
- Chartered accountant: Can now apply
- Insolvency practitioner: Can now apply
- Financial services: Restrictions lifted
- Company director: Can now act

**DBS checks**: IVA doesn't show (never did)

**Credit checks by employers**: IVA still shows for 6 years from start

### Banking After IVA

**Current accounts**: Full access restored

**Previously difficult banks**: May now accept

**Options improve**: Standard current accounts available

**Overdrafts**: Possible but start small

### Mortgages After IVA

**Immediate post-completion**: Very difficult

**3-4 years post-completion**: Realistic with specialist lenders

**Requirements**:
- Large deposit (25-40% typically)
- Clean credit 3+ years
- Stable employment
- Good income
- No other credit issues

**Specialist mortgage brokers**:
- Understand IVA history
- Access specialist lenders
- Can guide process
- Worth the fee

**Expected rates**:
- 1-3% above standard rates initially
- Improves with remortgages
- Eventually access standard rates

### Emotional Impact of Completion

**Common feelings**:

**Relief**: ✅ "Finally free of debt"

**Pride**: ✅ "I did it - 5 years of discipline"

**Joy**: ✅ "No more restrictions"

**Anxiety**: ⚠️ "Can I manage money now?"

**Pressure**: ⚠️ "Must not get into debt again"

**All normal emotions**

**Tips for adjustment**:
1. Don't immediately take credit
2. Continue budgeting habits
3. Build emergency fund (3-6 months expenses)
4. Gradual lifestyle improvements
5. Seek counseling if money anxiety persists

## IVA Failure - When Things Go Wrong

### What is IVA Failure?

**IVA fails when**:
- ❌ You can't continue payments
- ❌ Breach IVA terms significantly
- ❌ Creditors petition to terminate
- ❌ IP withdraws
- ❌ Voluntary termination agreed

**Result**: IVA legally ends, debts return

### IVA Failure Rate

**Industry statistics**:
- Failure rate: 30-40% approximately
- Completion rate: 60-70%
- Most failures: Years 2-3

**Why failures happen**:
1. Income loss (redundancy, illness)
2. Can't afford payments
3. Life changes (divorce, new baby)
4. Creditor challenges
5. Compliance breaches

### Common Reasons for Failure

**1. Job loss** (most common)
```
Scenario:
Month 24: Lose job
Unable to find new employment
Benefits insufficient for IVA payment
Can't sustain payments
IVA fails
```

**2. Income reduction**
```
Scenario:
Self-employed income drops 50%
Can no longer afford £400/month payment
IP unable to reduce enough
IVA becomes unsustainable
```

**3. Relationship breakdown**
```
Scenario:
Divorce proceedings
Loss of partner's financial contribution
Additional costs (legal, housing)
Can't maintain IVA
```

**4. Health issues**
```
Scenario:
Serious illness
Unable to work
Benefits don't cover IVA payment
Long-term prognosis unclear
IVA fails
```

**5. Compliance breach**
```
Scenario:
Took £2,000 loan without permission
Didn't declare inheritance
Creditor discovers breach
Petitions to fail IVA
IP agrees IVA failed
```

**6. Hidden income discovered**
```
Scenario:
Creditor proves undeclared income
IVA based on false information
IP terminates IVA
Fraudulent IVA
```

**7. Missed payments**
```
Scenario:
Missed 3+ consecutive payments
Not responding to IP
Can't catch up arrears
IP terminates IVA
```

### IVA Failure Process

**Step 1: Problem emerges**
- Can't pay
- Breach discovered
- Creditor objects

**Step 2: Communication with IP**
- You inform IP (or they discover)
- Discuss situation
- Explore options

**Step 3: Options assessment**

**Can the IVA be saved?**
- Payment break
- Payment reduction
- Variation
- Extension

**If YES**: IVA continues with changes

**If NO**: Proceed to termination

**Step 4: Termination decision**
- IP decides IVA not viable
- Notifies you
- Notifies creditors
- Prepares termination

**Step 5: Certificate of termination**
- IP issues formal termination
- States reason
- Ends IVA legally
- Reports to creditors

**Step 6: Return to creditors**
- Creditors resume collection rights
- Can pursue you for balance
- Interest may resume
- Legal action possible

### What Happens to Payments Made?

**Money already paid**:
- Creditors keep what they received
- IP fees already taken
- Cannot be recovered

**Example**:
```
IVA duration: 30 months (failed)
Total paid: £9,000
IP fees: £2,500
To creditors: £6,500

Original debt: £40,000
Creditors received: £6,500
Still owed: £33,500

Creditors write off the £6,500 received? NO
Creditors credit £6,500 against debt
Still owe: £33,500
```

**Creditors can still pursue full balance** minus what they received

### Consequences of IVA Failure

**Immediate effects**:

**1. Creditor protection ends**
- No longer protected
- Creditors resume contact
- Legal action restarts
- Court claims proceed

**2. Debt returns**
```
Original debt: £40,000
Paid through IVA: £6,500 (to creditors)
Outstanding: £33,500
Plus: Interest from date of failure
Plus: Charges and fees
```

**3. Credit file impact**
- IVA failure recorded
- Credit score further damaged
- Stays on file 6 years from IVA start
- Worse than completed IVA

**4. No debt write-off**
- Remaining debt still owed
- No legal forgiveness
- Back to pre-IVA situation
- But with fewer options

**5. Back to square one**
- Debt problem unresolved
- Must find alternative
- Limited options remaining

### Options After IVA Failure

**Option 1: Revive the IVA**

**If circumstances improve quickly**:
- New job found
- Income restored
- Can catch up arrears

**Process**:
- Contact IP immediately
- Propose revival terms
- Needs creditor approval
- Rare but possible

**Option 2: Start new IVA**

**If circumstances changed**:
- Different income level
- Different proposal
- New IP potentially

**Challenges**:
- Creditors skeptical (failed before)
- Lower approval chances
- May require better terms

**Realistic**: Only if credible change in circumstances

**Option 3: Debt Relief Order (DRO)**

**If now qualify**:
- Debt under £30,000
- Disposable income under £75/month
- Assets under £2,000
- Live in England/Wales

**Process**:
- Apply through approved advisor
- £90 fee
- 12-month period
- Debt written off if circumstances unchanged

**Good option if**: Income/assets now low enough

**Option 4: Debt Management Plan (DMP)**

**Informal arrangement**:
- Negotiate with each creditor
- Affordable monthly payment
- No legal protection
- Flexible

**Advantages**:
- No approval needed
- Flexible payments
- Can start immediately

**Disadvantages**:
- No legal protection
- Interest continues (usually)
- No guaranteed write-off
- Creditors can still take action

**Realistic**: For temporary difficulties

**Option 5: Bankruptcy**

**If no other option**:
- File bankruptcy petition
- £680 fee
- Discharge in 12 months
- Most debts written off

**When appropriate**:
- Can't afford any payment
- Limited assets to lose
- Need fresh start
- Other solutions failed

**Consequences**:
- Assets sold (home, car over £1,000)
- Public record (Gazette)
- Employment restrictions (some roles)
- Credit impact (6 years)

**But**: Definite end (12 months)

**Option 6: Continue Struggling**

**Not recommended but realistic**:
- Some people return to juggling debts
- Making minimum payments
- Dealing with creditor pressure

**Why people choose this**:
- Avoiding bankruptcy
- Hope situation improves
- Denial/avoidance

**Risks**:
- Situation worsens
- Legal action proceeds
- Mental health impact
- No end in sight

**Determination**: "Will find another way"

**All valid emotions**

**Remember**:
- IVA failure doesn't define you
- Circumstances often outside control
- Other options exist
- Fresh start still possible

### Learning from IVA Failure
