She initially tried managing with reduced spending and 
negotiated reduced payments with creditors. However, over 
18 months the situation became unsustainable. Interest and 
charges continued, and creditors began legal action.

Mrs Smith now seeks an IVA as a responsible way to repay 
what she can afford while gaining legal protection."
```

## Common Proposal Challenges

### Challenge 1: Income vs Expenses Shows Deficit

**Problem**: Expenses exceed income on paper

**Solutions**:
- Identify non-essential expenses to reduce
- Include partner's contribution if appropriate
- Show how currently managing (borrowed from family, etc.)
- Demonstrate commitment to budget discipline

**IP may**:
- Adjust expenses to guideline levels
- Request evidence of expense reduction
- Suggest higher contribution after trial period

### Challenge 2: Large Equity in Property

**Problem**: Significant home equity makes equity release difficult

**Solutions**:
- Explain remortgage challenges (credit damage, affordability)
- Propose 12-month extension as alternative
- Show commitment despite challenges
- Consider third-party contribution

**Creditors may**:
- Request higher monthly payment
- Insist on equity release attempts
- Require family member lump sum
- Accept extension alternative

### Challenge 3: Recent Credit Usage

**Problem**: Taken credit recently before IVA (looks like fraud)

**Solutions**:
- Explain circumstances honestly
- Show credit used for essentials
- Demonstrate no luxury spending
- Show debt problem was longstanding

**Creditors may**:
- Object to including recent debts
- Require higher dividend
- Request police investigation (if extreme)

**Timing matters**:
- Credit within 1-3 months: Very problematic
- Credit 3-6 months: May raise questions
- Credit 6-12 months: Usually acceptable

### Challenge 4: Self-Employment Income Irregular

**Problem**: Income varies month-to-month

**Solutions**:
- Use average of last 12 months
- Conservative estimate
- Build in lower payment initially
- Increase at reviews when proven

**IP may**:
- Request 12 months accounts minimum
- Use tax return figures
- Suggest 6-month review instead of annual
- Propose graduated payment (starts low, increases)

### Challenge 5: High Living Costs

**Problem**: Expenses seem excessive to creditors

**Solutions**:
- Justify with evidence (large family, medical needs)
- Compare to ONS/Insolvency Service guidelines
- Show expenses reasonable for circumstances
- Reduce non-essentials

**Areas creditors scrutinize**:
- Food/housekeeping: Should align with household size
- Transport: Must be necessary
- Communications: Basic packages acceptable
- Entertainment: Minimal during IVA
