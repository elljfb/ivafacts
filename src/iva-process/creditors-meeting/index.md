## Creditors' Meeting & Decision Procedure

The creditors' meeting (now typically called the "decision procedure") is where your creditors vote on whether to approve your IVA proposal. This is the pivotal moment that determines if your IVA will proceed. Understanding this process helps manage expectations and prepare for the outcome.

## What is the Decision Procedure?

### Modern Process (Since 2016)

**Insolvency Rules 2016** changed how creditors vote:

**Old system** (pre-2016):
- Physical or virtual meeting
- Creditors attend in person/by phone
- Vote taken at specific time
- Meeting chaired by nominee

**Current system** (post-2016):
- **Decision procedure** (usually virtual)
- No physical meeting required
- Creditors vote by deadline
- Results announced after deadline
- More efficient and cost-effective

**Your IP can still hold physical meeting** if appropriate, but most use decision procedure.

### Timeline

**Typical schedule**:

**Day 0**: Proposal sent to creditors
- Full proposal document
- Statement of Affairs
- Voting forms
- Notice of decision date

**Days 1-14**: Consideration period
- Creditors review proposal
- Ask questions
- Consider their position
- Complete voting forms

**Day 14**: Decision deadline
- All votes must be received by specified time (usually 12pm)
- Late votes not counted
- IP counts votes

**Day 14 (afternoon)**: Result announced
- IP announces outcome
- All parties notified
- IVA proceeds or fails

**Week 3-4**: Confirmation
- Completion certificates sent
- IVA formally begins (if approved)
- First payment due

## The 75% Approval Threshold

### How Voting Works

**Key principle**: **One pound = one vote**

Not one creditor = one vote, but **debt value** = votes

**Example**:
```
Creditor A: Owed £20,000 (48% of total debt)
Creditor B: Owed £15,000 (36% of total debt)
Creditor C: Owed £7,000 (16% of total debt)
Total debt: £42,000
```

**If they vote**:
```
Creditor A: VOTES YES (£20,000 = 48%)
Creditor B: VOTES YES (£15,000 = 36%)
Creditor C: VOTES NO (£7,000 = 16%)

Total YES votes: £35,000 / £42,000 = 83.3%

Result: APPROVED ✅ (over 75% threshold)
```

### Minimum Threshold: 75%

**For approval, need**:
- 75% or more of debt value voting YES
- Of those creditors who actually vote
- Non-voters essentially abstain

**Examples of approval**:

**Scenario 1: High approval**
```
Total debt: £30,000
Votes received: £28,000
YES votes: £25,000
Percentage: 89.3% - APPROVED ✅
```

**Scenario 2: Just approved**
```
Total debt: £30,000
Votes received: £24,000
YES votes: £18,000
Percentage: 75% exactly - APPROVED ✅
```

**Scenario 3: Failed**
```
Total debt: £30,000
Votes received: £25,000
YES votes: £17,000
Percentage: 68% - REJECTED ❌
```

### Non-Voting Creditors

**If creditor doesn't vote**:
- Not counted as YES or NO
- Effectively neutral
- Reduces total votes considered

**Example**:
```
Total debt: £40,000

Creditor A: £20,000 - VOTES YES
Creditor B: £15,000 - VOTES YES
Creditor C: £5,000 - NO VOTE

Total votes received: £35,000
YES votes: £35,000
Percentage: 100% of votes cast

Result: APPROVED ✅
```

**This helps you**: Non-voters don't hurt approval chances

## What Creditors Consider

### 1. Return vs Bankruptcy

**Most important factor**

**They compare**:
```
IVA Proposal: 60p per pound
Bankruptcy alternative: 5p per pound

Decision: APPROVE IVA (55p more per pound)
```

**If IVA offers significantly better return**: Very likely approval

**If IVA similar to bankruptcy**: May reject or request modifications

### 2. Affordability and Sustainability

**Creditors assess**:
- Is income sufficient?
- Are expenses reasonable?
- Can debtor sustain payments for 5-6 years?
- Is employment stable?

**Red flags**:
- Income barely covers expenses
- Unrealistic budget
- Unstable employment
- History of failed payment plans

**Green flags**:
- Clear disposable income
- Stable employment
- Realistic expenses
- Good payment history before crisis

### 3. Cause of Debt

**Acceptable reasons**:
- ✅ Relationship breakdown
- ✅ Illness/injury
- ✅ Job loss/redundancy
- ✅ Business failure
- ✅ Income reduction
- ✅ Unexpected crisis
- ✅ Honest poor management

**Problematic reasons**:
- ❌ Gambling addiction (without treatment)
- ❌ Fraud
- ❌ Recent reckless spending
- ❌ Credit taken knowing couldn't repay

### 4. Asset Realization

**Creditors want to know**:
- Are all assets declared?
- Will they be used appropriately?
- Is equity release proposal reasonable?

**Property equity**:
- Must be addressed in year 5
- Remortgage attempts required
- Extension alternative if can't release

**Vehicle values**:
- Should be reasonable for circumstances
- Luxury cars may need downsizing
- Essential for work = protected

### 5. Recent Credit Use

**Timeline matters**:

**Credit 12+ months before IVA**:
- ✅ Generally fine
- Normal credit use
- No concerns

**Credit 6-12 months before**:
- ⚠️ May raise questions
- Depends on circumstances
- Should be explainable

**Credit 0-6 months before**:
- ❌ Very problematic
- Appears fraudulent
- Likely objections

**Credit after financial difficulties began**:
- Worst case scenario
- May exclude from IVA
- Possible criminal fraud

### 6. Previous Debt Solutions

**If you've tried other solutions**:
- ✅ Shows good faith
- ✅ Demonstrates effort
- ✅ IVA is last resort

**Previous attempts**:
- Informal arrangements
- Debt Management Plan
- Payment holidays
- Negotiated reductions

**Creditors view positively**: Tried alternatives first

### 7. Honesty and Transparency

**Proposal should**:
- Include all creditors
- Declare all assets
- Show all income
- Explain situation fully

**Omissions or lies**:
- ❌ Destroy trust
- ❌ Likely rejection
- ❌ Possible criminal charges

## Voting Options for Creditors

### 1. Vote to Approve (As Proposed)

**Unconditional approval**:
- Accept proposal as written
- No changes requested
- IVA proceeds exactly as proposed

**Example vote**:
```
"Bank A votes to APPROVE the proposal without modification.
Debt: £12,000"
```

### 2. Vote to Approve (With Modifications)

**Conditional approval**:
- Approve if changes made
- Specify required modifications
- Must still get 75% including modifications

**Common modifications requested**:

**Higher payment**:
```
"Creditor B votes to approve IF monthly payment increased 
from £250 to £300. Debt: £8,000"
```

**Longer term**:
```
"Creditor C votes to approve IF term extended to 72 months 
instead of 60 months. Debt: £6,500"
```

**Different equity release terms**:
```
"Creditor D votes to approve IF debtor agrees to 
compulsory equity release in year 5 with no extension 
option. Debt: £9,000"
```

**If modifications requested**:
- IP considers if reasonable
- You must agree to modifications
- If you agree: Modified proposal approved
- If you disagree: Proposal fails

### 3. Vote to Reject

**Outright rejection**:
- Do not approve
- No modifications offered
- Want bankruptcy or full payment

**Example vote**:
```
"Creditor E votes to REJECT the proposal.
Reason: Dividend insufficient, prefer bankruptcy.
Debt: £4,000"
```

**Why creditors reject**:
- Dividend too low
- Don't trust debtor
- Think bankruptcy better
- Unhappy with circumstances
- Recent credit to them specifically

### 4. No Vote Submitted

**Abstention** (effectively):
- Form not returned
- No position stated
- Doesn't count toward 75%

**Reasons for non-voting**:
- Oversight
- Too small to bother
- Can't be located
- Indifferent to outcome
- Already written off debt

## Large Creditor Dynamics

### Single Large Creditor (Over 25%)

**Significant power**:
- Can block approval alone (if over 25% of debt)
- Their vote crucial
- May demand modifications

**Example**:
```
Total debt: £40,000
Creditor A (bank): £30,000 (75% of debt)
Other creditors: £10,000 (25% of debt)

If Creditor A votes NO:
Maximum approval possible: 25% - FAILS ❌

Creditor A effectively has veto power
```

**IP strategy**:
- Engage large creditors early
- Address their concerns
- Negotiate modifications if needed
- Ensure proposal meets their criteria

### Multiple Large Creditors

**Coalition effect**:
- Top 2-3 creditors often control 60-80% of debt
- If they agree, approval likely
- IP focuses communication on them

**Example**:
```
Total debt: £50,000
Creditor A: £20,000 (40%)
Creditor B: £15,000 (30%)
Creditor C: £10,000 (20%)
Others: £5,000 (10%)

If A + B approve: 70% - not quite enough
If A + B + C approve: 90% - APPROVED ✅
```

## Special Creditor Types

### HMRC (Tax Debts)

**HM Revenue & Customs**:
- Often large creditor
- Follows strict guidelines
- Less flexible than banks
- May object to low dividends

**HMRC considerations**:
- Is IVA return better than bankruptcy?
- Has taxpayer been compliant?
- Are current tax obligations being met?
- Is income disclosure accurate?

**HMRC typically approves if**:
- ✅ Better return than bankruptcy
- ✅ All tax returns filed
- ✅ Current year tax being paid
- ✅ Full disclosure of income

### Council Tax Arrears

**Local authorities**:
- Priority creditors (normally)
- Included in IVA as unsecured
- Usually vote to approve
- Want payments more than bankruptcy

**Generally supportive of IVAs**

### Financial Institutions (Banks, Credit Cards)

**Major banks**:
- Experienced with IVAs
- Follow consistent policies
- Usually approve reasonable proposals
- May request modifications

**Typical bank approach**:
- Review dividend calculation
- Compare to bankruptcy
- Check for red flags
- Vote based on return

**Approval rate**: 70-80% typically

### Payday Lenders

**High-interest lenders**:
- More likely to object
- May claim recent lending
- Often vote no
- But small debt = small vote

**Strategy**: Ensure other creditors outweigh them

### Utility Companies

**Gas, electric, water providers**:
- Usually approve
- Want payment more than write-off
- Arrears often significant
- Rarely object

### Store Cards and Catalogues

**Retail creditors**:
- Usually approve
- Standard voting patterns
- Follow similar guidelines to banks

## Modifications and Negotiations

### Common Modification Requests

**1. Higher monthly payment**
```
Original proposal: £200/month
Modification: £250/month

If you can afford: Accept modification
If you can't: Proposal may fail
```

**2. Extended term**
```
Original: 60 months
Modification: 72 months (6 years)

Consideration: 12 months longer, more total paid
```

**3. Guaranteed equity release**
```
Original: Attempt release, extend if can't
Modification: Must release equity, no extension option

Risk: If genuinely can't remortgage, IVA may fail year 5
```

**4. Windfall percentages**
```
Original: 50% of bonuses to IVA
Modification: 100% of bonuses to IVA

Impact: Less benefit from income increases
```

### Can You Reject Modifications?

**Yes, but**:
- If you reject, proposal fails
- Back to square one
- Bankruptcy may follow

**Decision factors**:
- Can you afford modification?
- Is it reasonable?
- What's the alternative?

**Most people accept reasonable modifications**

### IP's Role in Negotiations

**Before decision procedure**:
- IP may contact large creditors
- Discuss concerns
- Negotiate terms
- Amend proposal if agreed

**This pre-negotiation**:
- ✅ Increases approval chances
- ✅ Addresses objections early
- ✅ Streamlines process

## Decision Day - What Happens

### The Deadline

**Typical deadline**: 12:00pm (noon) on decision day

**All votes must be received by this time**:
- Electronic votes
- Postal votes
- Proxy votes

**After deadline**:
- No more votes accepted
- IP begins counting
- Results compiled

### Counting the Votes

**IP's process**:
1. Verify each vote (proper creditor, valid form)
2. Calculate debt value per vote
3. Separate YES, NO, and MODIFICATIONS
4. Calculate percentages
5. Determine if modifications accepted (if you've agreed)
6. Declare result

**Takes 1-4 hours typically**

### Result Announcement

**IP notifies**:
- You (the debtor)
- All creditors
- Any guarantors

**Methods**:
- Email
- Phone call
- Formal letter
- Online portal update

**Same day usually** (afternoon of decision day)

```
Creditors would receive more in bankruptcy
OR
Return too low to justify IVA
```

**2. Unrealistic expenses**
```
Budget doesn't match guidelines
Excessive non-essential spending
Can't be supported
```

**3. Recent credit abuse**
```
Credit taken shortly before IVA
Appears fraudulent
Creditor feels misled
```

**4. Hidden assets**
```
Asset discovered not declared
Trust destroyed
Fraud suspected
```

**5. Unstable income**
```
Self-employed with irregular income
Employment insecure
History of job changes
Payment sustainability questioned
```

**6. Failed previous IVAs**
```
Previous IVA failed
Creditors skeptical
Trust issue
```

**7. Large single creditor objection**
```

Enough to block approval
May have specific grievance
```
